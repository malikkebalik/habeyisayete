In the 1970s and 1980s, cocaine flowed into major American cities like New York and Miami through Blanco, and in turn, Blanco earned millions each month. When your child is named Michael Corleone, like Blanco’s son, you know you’re dealing with a criminal mastermind who means business.</p><p data-characters=235 data-current-count=235 data-injectable=false>Before long, U.S. law enforcement caught up with Blanco, and by 1985, Blanco was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Blanco would later face a series of murder charges brought about when <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of her most trusted associates snitched on her</a>.</p><h2 id=h-blanco-s-right-hand-man-agreed-to-testify-against-her data-injectable=false>Blanco’s “right-hand man” agreed to testify against her</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=535 data-injectable=true>via Netflix/YouTube</figure><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=449 data-injectable=true>While serving 15 years on drug charges, Jorge “Rivi” Ayala, Blanco’s right-hand man and rumored former lover, who also served as her hitman, agreed to testify against his former boss in Florida, alleging he carried out killings Blanco ordered. Ayala’s testimony collapsed when he was embroiled in a phone sex and bribery scandal involving secretaries at the Miami-Dade state attorney’s office, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AP</a> reported in 1998.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>That same year, however, Blanco pleaded guilty to three counts of second-degree murder and sentenced to 20 more years in prison. In the end, Ayala was just one of many who flipped on Blanco, including <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jesus Castro</a> and Carmen Caban, who testified at Blanco’s drug trials.</p><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=482 data-injectable=true>In 2002, Blanco suffered a heart attack while in prison, and because of those health problems, she was released in 2004 and deported to Colombia.
