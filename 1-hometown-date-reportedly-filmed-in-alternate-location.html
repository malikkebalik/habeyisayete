As the season winds down, the lead generally travels to meet their final three or four prospects’ families in <a href=#>their hometowns.</a> Jenn Tran’s season is no different, except she traveled to meet Marcus’ friends instead of his family.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jenn-Tran-and-Marcus.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-4_60>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reality Steve</a>, Marcus’ hometown date didn’t take place where one would suspect. Marcus is originally from North Carolina but was spotted with Jenn in Tacoma, Washington. Per Reality Steve, Marcus isn’t close to his family but has a large network of friends in Washington. Marcus reportedly settled in the West Coast locale following his time in the army.</p><p id=par-5_50>From the sounds of it, Marcus’ hometown date was about meeting his pals, not about meeting his biological family. According to the spoilers expert, Jenn didn’t mind not meeting Marcus’ family. Things with his friends seemingly went well. Spoilers suggest the 31-year-old veteran advances to the infamous fantasy suites episode.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-bachelorette-spoilers-reveal-jenn-tran-filmed-3-other-hometown-dates>‘The Bachelorette’ spoilers reveal Jenn Tran filmed 3 other hometown dates</h2><p id=par-6_40>While Marcus’ hometown date was a bit unconventional, three other dates were more in line with how the hometown visits normally go. Jenn traveled to Houston, Texas; Fairfield, Connecticut; and Kansas City, Missouri, for her other family meet and greets.</p><p id=par-7_38>Devin Strader, 28, hails from Houston. Jeremy Simon, 30, is a real estate investor from Connecticut. The final hometown date, a mystery until the series premiered, went to Jonathon Johnson, a 27-year-old creative director from Kansas City, Missouri.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Jenn-Tran-2.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-when-does-season-21-of-the-bachelorette-end>When does season 21 of ‘The Bachelorette’ end?</h2><p id=par-8_44>While the series is still in its early episodes, a finale isn’t far off. The series premiered on July 8 and is expected to wrap up around the end of August. That would give Jenn Tran roughly eight weeks to find her perfect match.</p><p id=par-9_59>The season was filmed in the spring, with the contestants and Tran vacating the famed Bachelor Mansion before Joan Vassos moved in to film the inaugural season of <a href=#>The Golden Bachelorette</a>. Joan’s season will kick off after Jenn makes her final selection. There is no word on who fans can expect to appear as the next bachelor just yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMm5icoJWhvLOx062cZquVlsCwuoxraGaroKS2rbHRrGRqZZikuqbAzrClZpyRqbJuvsSppquslZm5unnFoqOmnZRitq95wKWrnqqelsGmecuompqsmaS7b7TTpqNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
