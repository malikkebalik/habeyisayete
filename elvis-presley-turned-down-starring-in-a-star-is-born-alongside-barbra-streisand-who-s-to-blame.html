At the time, Presley was performing at Las Vegas’ Caesars Palace.</p><p id=par-3_43>Presley hadn’t made a film <a href=#>since 1969’s Change of Habit</a>. However, he was reportedly looking to return to the movie industry and wanted to be taken seriously as an actor. Therefore, the meaty role of a fading rock star greatly appealed to him.</p><p id=par-4_47>Presley pal Joe Esposito wrote in his book Good Rockin’ Tonight that he and Jerry Schilling joined Presley during the infamous meeting with Streisand and Peters. “He was hooked,” Esposito wrote. But he told the couple he needed to talk to his manager, Colonel Tom Parker.</p><p id=par-5_16>“But to the guys, he was more enthusiastic. ‘I’m gonna do it!’ he vowed,” Esposito wrote.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ultimately-colonel-tom-parker-shut-down-the-project>Ultimately, Colonel Tom Parker shut down the project</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/a-star-is-born-movie-poster.jpg><p id=par-6_40>Per <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultimate Classic Rock</a>, Colonel Tom Parker wasn’t interested in allowing Elvis Presley to get his creative juices flowing again as an actor. Ultimately, it was all about money and how Colonel Tom Parker wanted his client to be paid.</p><p id=par-7_58>Warner Bros. and Streisand initially offered the King of Rock and Roll a $500,000 salary and 10 percent of the film’s net profits. For good measure, Presley would be able to retain any money generated from concerts filmed for the finished picture. However, Warner Bros. and Streisand would own the rights to any music and a soundtrack album.</p><p id=par-8_49>Parker wanted a different estimate. Instead, he asked for double the salary, a total of $1 million, 50 percent of the film’s profits, a large expense account, money generated from the soundtrack, and approval for any songs Presley appeared on. Oh, and Presley’s name had to be above Streisand’s.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-original-script-for-a-star-is-born-is-in-graceland-s-archives>The original script for ‘A Star is Born’ is in Graceland’s archives</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_41>The proposed contract for Elvis Presley’s participation in A Star is Born remains in the Graceland archives.
