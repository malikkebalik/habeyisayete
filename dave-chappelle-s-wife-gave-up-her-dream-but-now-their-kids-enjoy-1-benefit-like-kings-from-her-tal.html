After that, they made some appearances together but Elaine prefers to stay out of the spotlight. The couple even moved to rural Ohio so they can live low-key.</p><p id=par-5_59>“I’ll be reminded that I’m a celebrity here, but I don’t think about it at all until somebody asks me for a selfie or something,” Dave said during an interview with CBS. “It won’t even occur to me that’s what it is … It’s almost like a nature reserve where they’ll let me run free. I’m a protected commodity.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Their children benefit from Elaine’s talent every day</h2><p id=par-6_30>Dave and Elaine have three children.

I came home from the road not long ago–I was gone for weeks and weeks, and when I came back, nobody was home. Not one person in my&nbsp;family&nbsp;thought maybe I’d like to see them when I got back,” he recalled. “That s*** was a wake-up call. When my kids were little and the tour bus would pull up to the house, [they’d] spill out. ‘Dad is home, hooray!’ Then as the years went on, they’d get less interested.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSxosLEZpqhmaClsq24xKxksKGWmnqordWeZK6oXZm%2Fpq3MZpmurF2jvLh506GcoqpdoLalv4yepaOnqWJ%2Bbq7Ep5yfoaRiuaq3xGaioqaXqHqnvs6mZKGdomLBorjEp6tnoKSiuXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
