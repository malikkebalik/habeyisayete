The allegations state that when the victim was 16, he attended a party where Luner supplied him with drugs, performed a sex act on him then encouraged him to have sex with a male friend. The victim claims that the assault left him with extreme emotional damage that to this day caused him to have drinking problems and issues with his sexuality. On April 2, 2018 he filed a $250 million lawsuit against Jamie Luner. It should also be noted that the accuser reportedly has filed many frivolous lawsuits in the past. So many that he actually needs special approval from a judge to file lawsuits. He has filed more than 20 suits in the last few years, many of which were ultimately deemed to be without merit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLeiucieZKWtnpq%2FbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
