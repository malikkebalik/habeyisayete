"I think this record is actually older than ‘WAP.’ It is everyone’s favourite."</span></p><p><span>Elsewhere, during an&nbsp;Instagram Live, Cardi revealed that the song would be dropping without an&nbsp;accompanying&nbsp;music video due to issues with her&nbsp;record label.</span></p><p>In a conversation with&nbsp;Mariah Carey&nbsp;for&nbsp;Interview&nbsp;magazine in late February 2021, Cardi spoke about the expectations for her new record.</p><p><span>"I feel like I’m missing some songs," Cardi told Mariah. "Everybody’s rushing me to put it out, but I don’t know if it’s the right time. When I do interviews, I like to be in people’s faces. I hate Zoom meetings. They’re just so weird. I like to do listening parties. You can’t even tour. That s**t’s wack as f**k."</span></p><p><span><span>"I do have a song like ‘Be Careful,’" she revealed, after Mariah said the Invasion Of Privacy track was her&nbsp;favourite, "but I think it’s more personal. People were saying, ‘You need to be softer. You need to talk more about yourself.’ And I was telling them that it’s really hard for me to do love records and express myself like that because I never do that. I don’t talk about love and s**t."</span></span></p><p>On February 1st 2021, Cardi announced the release of her single 'Up', which is expected to appear on her new album. The song and video dropped on 4th February.</p><p><span>The&nbsp;artwork sees Cardi perched on a round metal swing suspended in the air&nbsp;against a cityscape backdrop, her&nbsp;body wrapped in a clear bodysuit with purple sparkles.</span></p><p>As for the music video, Cardi can be seen in a variety of colourful, racy outfits, joined by a bevy of dancers.&nbsp;</p><p><img title src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/assets.capitalxtra.com/2021/05/cardi-b-up-music-video-1612519659.png alt="Cardi B ‘Up’ music video" width=1822 height=1010 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>In January 2021, a report from <a href=#>Page Six</a> claimed Cardi was preparing to release a new solo single, with a source&nbsp;<span>describing it as "definitely a club song" with "lots of energy."</span></p><p><span>The source added that Cardi's camp had yet to make a decision&nbsp;<span>over what single would be Cardi’s next, and details of her upcoming releases were still being&nbsp;ironed out.</span></span></p><p>During an interview with <a href=#>Elle</a>, Cardi revealed that her new album will have some Beyoncé-inspired Lemonade moments, in reference to the singer's 2016 album which was partially about Jay-Z's infidelity.</p><p><span>"My music is always going to make a woman feel like a bad b*tch. When you make a woman feel like she’s the baddest b*tch in the room, to me, that’s female empowerment," she said. "But this album is going to be really different. Of course, it’s going to have my&nbsp;</span><span>Lemonade&nbsp;</span><span>moments, my personal relationship moments."</span></p><p><span>Cardi and her&nbsp;now-estranged&nbsp;husband Offset split in 2018 but later reconciled.&nbsp;On his solo&nbsp;album&nbsp;Father of 4, Offset&nbsp;apologises&nbsp;to Cardi for "breaking your heart, breaking our promise."</span></p><p><span><span><span>"If you all are so curious to know about my relationship and blah, blah, blah, I’m going to put it in the f*ckin’ music, and you can buy it, too," said Cardi.
