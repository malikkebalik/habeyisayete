CeeLo Green first became famous as a member of the hip-hop group Goodie Mob. The group released three critically-acclaimed albums before CeeLo went solo in 2002. However, his solo career did not go quite as planned, and he rose to international fame four years later as a member of the soul duo Gnarls Barkley, whose debut single "Crazy" became a hit and topped various singles charts worldwide. The success of their first single was followed by their album "St. Elsewhere," which climbed to #4 on the US "Billboard" 200.</p><p>In 2010, Green decided to take a break from his work with Gnarls Barkley and released the single "Fuck You." The song became an instant hit (certified 7Ã— Platinum by the RIAA), and his 2010 album "The Lady Killer" peaked at #2 on the "Billboard" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. CeeLo has released six studio albums as a solo artist, earning numerous awards and accolades for his work, including five Grammys. Green has served as a coach on NBC's hit singing competition "The Voice," and he performed with <a href=# title="Madonna Net Worth">Madonna</a> during her 2012 Super Bowl halftime show.

He began singing in church, and he attended the Riverside Military Academy in Gainesville, Georgia. When CeeLo was 16, his mother, Sheila (a firefighter and ordained minister), was paralyzed in a car accident and died two years later. He formed the band Goodie Mob with T-Mo, Khujo, and <a href=# title="Big Gipp Net Worth">Big Gipp</a> in 1991, and the group was starting to find success around the time Sheila passed away. Her death sent CeeLo into a deep depression, which he wrote about in several songs, including Goodie Mob's "Free" and Gnarls Barkley's "Just a Thought."</p><h2 id=music-career><strong>Music Career</strong></h2><p>Goodie Mob's debut album, Soul Food," was released in 1995, and it went Gold and reached #8 on the "Billboard" Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart.

Green left Goodie Mob and signed with Arista Records, but low record sales caused the label to drop him after his first two albums, "Cee-Lo Green and His Perfect Imperfections" (2002) and "Cee-Lo Greenâ€¦ Is the Soul Machine" (2004). In 2006, CeeLo formed Gnarls Barkley with DJ <a href=# title="Danger Mouse Net Worth">Danger Mouse</a>, and the duo released the album "St. Elsewhere" in 2006 and "The Odd Couple" in 2008.

The single earned five Grammy nominations, and a radio-friendly version, "Forget You," was also released. The album "The Lady Killer" was released in November of that year, and he followed it with "Cee Lo's Magic Moment" (a Christmas album) in 2012, "Heart Blanche" in 2015, and "CeeLo Green is Thomas Callaway" in 2020.
