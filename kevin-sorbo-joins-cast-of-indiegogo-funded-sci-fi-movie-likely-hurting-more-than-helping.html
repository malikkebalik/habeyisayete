The movie will tell the story of a businessman and secret “doomsday prepper” when, during a Las Vegas gala he has thrown for his friends and clients, people are told via an announcement by the U.S. president to seek shelter from a mysterious cloud. Sorbo is currently slated to play the United States President. No word on whether he will be as addicted to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">tone-deaf Tweets</a> as the real-life Sorbo and his favorite former president are.</p><p data-characters=375 data-current-count=375 data-injectable=false>This will be Sorbo’s second project with Mahal Empire, a local Las Vegas production company run by brothers Sonny and Michael Mahal. Sorbo starred as Guard Captain Baldur alongside Eric Roberts, Angie Everhart, and Daniel Baldwin in the company’s upcoming (and similarly crowdfunded) sword and sorcery film Devil’s Knight set to be released later this year.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=675 data-injectable=true></figure><p data-characters=234 data-current-count=234 data-injectable=false>Sorbo took to his own social media to promote Alien Storm, stating “I’ll be playing the president,” adding “because I should be the president, I’d run the country a lot better, I’ll tell you.”</p><p data-characters=207 data-current-count=441 data-injectable=true>Perhaps Sorbo should concentrate on a more realistic goal.
