While her life is hard, Kaoru’s day is often brightened by her three unusual roommates. Kaoru lives with the lazy bear Rilakkuma, the small and mischievous bear Korilakkuma and Kaoru’s hardworking pet bird Kiiroitori.

This series is produced by Dwarf, directed by Masahito Kobayashi of the same studio, and produced by San-X. In addition to Kaoru (voiced by Mikako Tabe), who first appeared in&nbsp;Rilakkuma and Kaoru, Rilakkuma, Korilakkuma, and Kiiroitori go to play at a theme park that is about to close. There, they encounter many events and meet different people in this eight-episode series of 15-minute episodes depicting their active daily lives.</p><h3 id=h-is-rilakkuma-a-sanrio-character data-injectable=false>Is Rilakkuma a Sanrio character?&nbsp;</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=545 data-current-count=845 data-injectable=true>Many people think Rilakkuma is a Sanrio character. However, this is not the case. Rilakkuma is made by another company called San-X. San-X was first formed in 1932 as Chida Handler. It didn’t take on its modern name of San-X until 1973. At first, San-X didn’t market via characters, but rather put various drawings and scenic images on its products. However, when their character Pinny-Mu became surprisingly popular in the late-80s, San-X shifted and became a character marketing company and launched a whole new slew of characters.</p><p data-characters=359 data-current-count=359 data-injectable=false>In 2003, San-X launched the Rilakkuma character. With a name that is a portmanteau of the words relax and kuma (the Japanese word for bear), Rilakkuma was first introduced to audiences via the four-panel comic series&nbsp;Rilakkuma Seikatsu. These comics laid out the character’s basic concept: that Rilakkuma was a bear who loved to relax and eat snacks.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=619 data-injectable=false>The character quickly became popular in Japan and is slowly growing in popularity in America, with the TV show helping speed up this growth. But while San-X has a similar name and business model to Hello Kitty creators Sanrio, the two companies are not linked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6roKWZm6DCrq3SZquhnZ2aerGt0aRkmpymmru1wdGeZKKrXae2ra3KpKymmV2WerStzaugqGWTna6zrcKtnKtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
