After the last fail went viral, Sajak took to Twitter to poop all over everyone’s party.</p><p data-characters=294 data-current-count=294 data-injectable=false>“It always pains me when nice people come on our show to play a game and win some money and maybe fulfill a lifelong dream, and are then subject to online ridicule when they make a mistake or something goes awry,” wrote Sajak at the start of a long-winded, nine-part Twitter thread.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=594 data-injectable=true>https://twitter.com/PatOnWheel/status/1499050877813870592</figure><p>“Last night’s ‘feather in your cap’ puzzle was a case in point. Sitting at home, it seems incredible that they couldn’t solve it, but I knew in real-time what was happening,” Sajak continued. The first attempted solve was ‘feather in your hat” which, by the way, is how a lot of people say it. So all three players thought it was a good solve, and were stunned when I said it was wrong.”</p><p>“Now imagine you’re on national TV, and you’re suddenly thrown a curve and you begin getting worried about looking stupid, and if the feather isn’t in your hat, where the heck can it be? You start flailing away looking for alternatives rather than synonyms for ‘hat.’</p><p>And, of course, when it’s solved, you want to crawl in a hole. I’ve been praised online for ‘keeping it together’ and not making fun of the players. Truth is, all I want to do is help to get them through it and convince them that those things happen even to very bright people.</p><p>But mocking them online and calling them names? These are good people in a bad situation under a kind of stress that you can’t begin to appreciate from the comfort of your couch. Good-natured laughter is one thing. Heck, they laughed at themselves. But, hey, cut them some slack. Unless you’re there, you have no idea how different it is in the studio.</p><p>I have fun with players and I tease them occasionally, but when things go wrong, I feel for them, and I try to salve the wounds on camera and off. So, yeah, it was an oddly entertaining puzzle and it’s okay to laugh at the situation. But have a little heart.</p><p>After all, you may be there one day. And no one wants to be trending on Twitter.</p><p data-characters=177 data-current-count=177 data-injectable=false>Jeez, Pat — we’re just trying to have a little fun! It’s true that no one wants to be trending on Twitter, but thems the risks you take when auditioning for Wheel.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tMSeo2anlmKzsL7TrqWeZZOku7Wx0q2Yp6yjYq%2B2usalnGaZnqjEpr6Mq5ynrJmjtG68xJ2YpWWSpK61ew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
