It's the one day of the year when you're encouraged to go all out and <a href=# class=T3D>act like someone</a> — or something — you're not. It's fun to think of something clever, interesting, <a href=# class=T3D>culturally relevant</a>, and cool that has the potential to <a href=# class=T3D>go viral online</a>, or just the ability to score you a few high-fives while you're out. The one downside to Halloween costumes? They can be elaborate and uncomfortable, which isn't exactly ideal in any situation, especially during a night you might be in a crowded area. When it comes to finding a festive <a href=# class=T3D>but still comfy</a> Halloween costume, pajamas are the solution. Thankfully, there are a bunch of Halloween costume ideas that you can literally just wear pajamas for (along with a few other easy accessories).</p><p>It might sound too good to be true, but seriously: There are some costumes where all you need is a set of pajamas that you (hopefully) already own, plus one or two add-ons. You'll be much more comfortable than everyone else, and you'll also get a ton of compliments. Plus, if you already own these items, then you'll save money on buying anything. Some require a little bit of creativity, while others <a href=# class=T3D>couldn't be simpler</a>. Of course, it can be really fun to go all out on Halloween and do something super extravagant, but sometimes you need a break from all of the fussy getups. Below are a few pajama Halloween costumes that will allow you to stay super comfy this spooky season.</p><p><i>We may receive a portion of sales if you purchase a product through a link in this article.</i></p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Holly Golightly From Breakfast At Tiffany's</h2></p><p>Dressing as Audrey Hepburn in Breakfast At Tiffany's gives you two options: the classic little black dress look, or her sleeping look, which is arguably the better one. You most likely already have an <a href=# rel=noreferrer>oversized white sleep shirt</a>, and if you don't, you can probably borrow one from someone else or snag an affordable one online. If you have <a href=# rel=noreferrer>purple tassel earrings</a>, even better — but this is one accessory you'll use even after Halloween is over. Add the appropriate sleep mask, and you're good to go.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">2</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Harry Styles In “Late Night Talking” Music Video</h2></p><p>While you might not be able to get your hands on Harry Styles’ Gucci pajama set from the actual <a href=#>“Late Night Talking” music video</a>, you can certainly pull off a similar look for Halloween. To dress as the pop heartthrob in his bed-filled paradise, all you have to do is wear a polka dot pajama set — preferably brown if you can find it. From there, layer on a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>cream blazer</a>, two pinned <a href=# rel=noreferrer>fake white lilies</a> on one of the lapels, and a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>large blue beaded necklace</a> to complete the look.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">3</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">The Lost Boys From Peter Pan</h2></p><p>Dressing as one of the Lost Boys from Peter Pan couldn't be easier — or more comfortable. You just need an <a href=# rel=noreferrer>animal onesie</a> (any will do, although a raccoon is pretty authentic!), and maybe a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>large goose feather</a> to glue onto the hood. That's it! It also makes a great group costume idea.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">4</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Taylor Swift In “You Need To Calm Down” Music Video</h2></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">5</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Max From Where The Wild Things Are</h2></p><p>Stay super comfy by dressing as Max from Where The Wild Things Are. A <a href=# rel=noreferrer>white onesie</a> is the most authentic, but you can really wear any color. Add a paper crown (maybe even with some added <a href=# rel=noreferrer>faux fur trim</a> if you have time for a mini DIY project), and if you want, a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>fake tail</a>. Adorable and easy!</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">6</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Sleeping Beauty</h2></p><p>This one is a bit of a pun, rather than the actual Disney princess: You're a sleeping beauty, get it?! You can wear any pair of pajamas and <a href=# rel=noreferrer>fuzzy slippers</a> you own here, as well as a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>fake tiara</a> and a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>blank sash</a> — super inexpensive. You can customize any blank sash (or just make one with paper) to write "beauty queen" so people get it.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">7</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Tom Cruise In Risky Business</h2></p><p>Another super easy Halloween costume made with an oversized white sleep shirt is Tom Cruise in Risky Business. You just need the shirt, the <a href=# rel=noreferrer>sunglasses</a>, and the <a href=# rel=noreferrer>plain white socks</a>. A very popular lazy costume option, but, hey, it gets the job done.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">8</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Phoebe Bridgers’ Punisher Skeleton</h2></p><p>If you consider yourself a “Pharb,” then this incredibly easy pajama costume is perfect. All you really need is a skeleton onesie to <a href=#>embody Phoebe Bridgers</a> on the cover of her hit album Punisher. If you want to take the costume to the next level, you could even wear a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>wavy silvery blonde wig</a> and carry around a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>prop guitar</a>. This also works as a great group costume if you want to be Bridgers’ entire band, as they also wore skeleton onesies on stage for the entire tour.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">9</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Rizzo From Grease</h2></p><p>A lot of people like to dress as the Pink Ladies from Grease, or <a href=#>Sandy</a>, but what about Rizzo during the slumber party? It's an iconic scene that deserves some Halloween love. If you have purple pajamas, or just a purple oversized shirt (remember to roll up the sleeves), then go for it! Add a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>blonde wig</a> if needed, and an <a href=# rel=noreferrer>empty bottle of wine</a>.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">10</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Beanie Baby</h2></p><p>Another super simple Halloween costume that involves only a onesie is to dress like a Beanie Baby. You can pick any animal you want, but a bear is classic (so grab a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>fuzzy bear ears headband</a>). Make it look more real by creating a big TY sign with <a href=# rel=noreferrer>cardboard or paper</a> to hang around your neck. This is another great easy group costume idea!</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">11</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">A Grandma</h2></p><p>If you have a nightgown and a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>bathrobe</a>, put it on, add some <a href=# rel=noreferrer>wire-rim glasses</a>, and voila: You're a grandma. This couldn't be easier. For the full effect, maybe even add some wrinkle lines with makeup.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">12</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Regina's Mom From Mean Girls</h2></p><p>If you have an old Juicy Couture sweat suit (or anything comparable) laying around, dressing as Regina George's mom (played by Amy Poehler) from <a href=#>Mean Girls</a> is the perfect costume. A <a href=# rel=noreferrer>stuffed dog</a> really makes it stand out.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">13</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Bananas In Pajamas</h2></p><p>This one will probably require you to buy a banana costume (unless, for some reason, you have one laying around). But once you have that, you can just wear it under a pair of <a href=# rel=noreferrer>blue and white striped pajamas</a>. Easy!</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">14</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">A Work From Home Zoom Caller</h2></p><p>This is another easy one, as you might already have all the components in your wardrobe. Dress up as someone <a href=#>working from home</a> and attending a Zoom meeting — but only halfway dressed. Keep your cozy pajama bottoms on, but then dress the top half in business casual clothing, such as a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>blazer</a>, <a href=# rel=noreferrer>chic oxford shirt</a>, and a sleek hairstyle.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">15</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Karen From Mean Girls</h2></p><p>You're a mouse, duh! No, actually, you're <a href=#>Karen Smith from Mean Girls</a> as a mouse at the Halloween party. If you don't mind wearing a black silky chemise out, along with <a href=# rel=noreferrer>mouse ears</a> and a <a href=# rel=noreferrer>pink sash belt</a>, then go for it. And, of course, walk around telling everyone you're a mouse and that your breasts can predict the weather.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">16</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">Cinderella</h2></p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">17</h2><h2 class="i7p qyd">The Girl From The Exorcist</h2></p><p>OK, all you need here is a nightgown — for the rest of the look, you'll need some Halloween costume makeup for fake vomit and <a href=# rel=noreferrer>stage blood</a>, and just make sure your hair is super messy.</p></figure><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p>This article was originally published on Sep. 27, 2018</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC4yJ%2BcaKiRn66urYyhmKWkn6yyprqMnKasrKWisrQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
