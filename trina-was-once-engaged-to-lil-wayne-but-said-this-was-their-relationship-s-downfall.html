It wasn’t a widely publicized relationship, and Trina revealed in a 2014 interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">VladTV</a> that it was kept that way on purpose.</p><p id=par-3_23>“It wasn’t kind of a big announcement,” she said. “I’m not big on the announcing thing.

We would talk, we would laugh, we would have fun. It was nothing flirty; it was nothing intimate.”</p><p id=par-7_38>“When [the relationship] happened, I never saw it coming,” she admitted. “I always knew [what] an amazing person that he was. It was just one of those kinds of things that I don’t want to lose our friendship.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Wayne-Trina.jpg><h2 id=h-trina-still-has-love-for-lil-wayne>Trina still has love for Lil Wayne</h2><p id=par-8_16>Trina reflected on her relationship with Lil Wayne in a 2017 interview with <a href=#>The Breakfast Club</a>.</p><p id=par-9_65>“Wayne is a very great person,” she said honestly. “Wayne never did anything wrong to me. The thing is, when I dated Wayne — which was so many years ago — we were just real young. Wayne was real young. I was real young. A part of it was, ‘I don’t even know what I’m doing, and I know you don’t know what you’re doing.'”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-10_43>The two maintained a close friendship over the years as well as a working relationship.
