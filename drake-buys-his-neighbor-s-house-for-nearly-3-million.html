You wish there was something you could do about it, but you can't. Call the cops? Nah, you like your neighbors too much to do that. So, you just suffer through the noise. But what if you could buy your neighbor's house to stop&nbsp;the noise, leaving you to do anything you pleased? Well, a certain rapper from Toronto did exactly that.. except in the reverse way. Allow us to explain.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>In Future's song "Where Ya At?" <a href=#><strong>Drake</strong></a> uttered the following, "I'll buy the neighbor's house if they complain about the noise." Well, it seems that Drake actually did what he said he'd do in the song, because Drake reportedly purchased his neighbor's home in Hidden Hills, California for a whopping $2.85 million. The reason?

It also reportedly has a space to keep horses, in case Drake and his friends are into that thing.</span></p><p class=p1><span class=s1>Drake bought the compound he currently lives in back in 2012 for $7.7 million. Though that sounds like a lot, the home was originally listed for a mind boggling $27 million. The 7444 square foot estate features seven bedrooms, nine bathrooms, a multi-million dollar pool with cascading waterfalls, a tennis court, a sand volleyball court, and a mechanical bull, among other things.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLnUrKCcZZ6axLR7w6uYpJ1dl8K6v4ynnKKfmJe8s7%2BMoaauq5Viu6at0aWwZmtdoratuMiopWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
