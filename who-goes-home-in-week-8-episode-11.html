I was training every day — I was swimming; I was running. I would run a random triathlon in the middle of the day in the heat for no reason at all, just because it’s, like, The Challenge. You never know what you’re going to expect.”</p><p id=par-6_21>Despite his preparation, Tyler couldn’t make it through.
