Although reviews scattered online seem in favor of the fifth and final installment in the much-loved franchise, there’s one common gripe with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny</strong></a> that fans can’t seem to shake off.</p><p data-characters=514 data-current-count=874 data-injectable=true>In the opening 20-25 minutes of the movie, we see a younger Harrison Ford and his <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">then-colleague Basil Shaw</a>, a fellow archaeologist from&nbsp;Oxford, captured by Nazis while attempting to retrieve the&nbsp;Lance of Longinus. The pair are interrogated by the Nazis, but Jones eventually escapes and rescues Shaw, jumping from a train loaded with stolen antiques. On the surface, nothing seems particularly wrong with that scene, but plenty of disgruntled viewers have spotted a major flaw: poor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">de-aging technology</a>.</p><p data-characters=446 data-current-count=446 data-injectable=true>As you’ll glimpse in the GIF below, Dial of Destiny‘s de-aging efforts are incredibly patchy. Rather than simply casting a younger actor in Ford’s likeness, the Lucasfilm made the decision to de-age Ford, who’s about to be 81 years old. As several tweets point out, the de-aged version of Indiana Jones doesn’t physically match up with Ford’s raspy, 80-year-old voice… and that can be rather distracting.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>The de-aging stuff in DIAL OF DESTINY is the crowning example of why studios need to stop de-aging actors in movies. The first 20 minutes of this film are so distracting because the technology does not match with Harrison Ford’s grizzled, 80-year-old voice. Just stop, studios. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/BdP3H0oFS2</a></p>— Sean (@SeanJ8) <a href=#>June 30, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true>https://twitter.com/AnghusH/status/1674760175125684225</figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr><a href=#>#DialOfDestiny</a> is kind of great tbh! Big fun Indiana Jones romp, Ford is GREAT, my only complaints are some dodgy de-aging (just cast younger actors!!) and the odd janky green screen – but story itself is a FUN.

It didn’t suck and (some rubbery de-aging aside) was actually pretty good! The last act is a big swing that I enjoyed more than I thought I would <a href=#>#relieved</a></p>— Paul Claydon (@Mr_Claydon) <a href=#>June 30, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=429 data-current-count=429 data-injectable=true>Although many are suggesting that Dial of Destiny succeeded where Crystal Skull failed, there are those who are willing to let bygones be bygones as Dial of Destiny proves to be just as stodgy as its predecessor. Overall, it’s quite the mixed bag of reactions; some agree that Jones’ swan song bid farewell to the franchise in the best way, whereas others are left unfulfilled by a sequel that chooses to cut corners.</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>There’s truly no definitive outlook on Dial of Destiny that isn’t a personal preference, but the de-aging segment is notoriously distracting, which takes away from Ford’s acting. Thankfully, newcomer <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Phoebe Waller-Bridge</a> carries some of the Lucasfilm’s slack to make her mark on the Indiana Jones world. We’ll give credit where it’s due to Mads Mikkelsen, as well, who ticked off portraying both a Bond villain and an Indiana Jones villain in one eventful career.</p><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=65 data-injectable=false>Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny is showing in theaters now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJoq6GdXZu2s7%2FTZmlpZZ2eu7bAxKxkqJ5dnrultcCnmGain6OytHnAp5tmrJiaeqW1wKVkqJ5dmbK0wMinsGaZopp6qLHTraCnn12Yv7avyJ%2Bgnpxdm7yzecSxmJysnK56uLTArWSyp6Viwam1zaRm</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
