The Kentucky native then formed numerous alliances with members of both the David tribe and the Goliath tribe, most notably an alliance with&nbsp;Angelina Keeley&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mike White that caused the trio to secure their spots in the final tribal council (but the journey was far from smooth sailing).</p><p data-characters=405 data-current-count=405 data-injectable=true>Using numerous advantages to further his position in the game, Nick became a massive threat to take home the title of “Sole Survivor” and the million-dollar cash prize, however, he managed to avoid elimination after elimination due to his ties to both Angelina and Mike, as well as his ability to win the last three challenges. His social, strategic, and physical game was seriously top notch!</p><p data-characters=176 data-current-count=176 data-injectable=false>Blowing the jury away during the final tribal council, Nick Wilson beat Mike White and Angelina Keeley in a 7-3-0 vote, prior to returning for Survivor: Winners at War in 2020.</p><p data-characters=564 data-current-count=740 data-injectable=true>Nick’s journey on Survivor: Winners at War was far less impressive than his journey on Survivor: David vs Goliath, despite finding himself in a powerful position due to his pre-merge alliance with Sophie Clarke,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wendell Holland</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Yul Kwon</a>. Much like the champion of Survivor: Winners at War, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tony Vlachos</a>, Nick found himself to be the swing vote time and time again, flipping between alliances to further his position in the game, however, his duplicity caused him to be blindsided at the final six, ultimately leaving the game in seventh place.</p><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>Despite playing a phenomenal game during Survivor: David vs Goliath that resulted in zero votes cast against him all season long, Nick’s reputation went downhill after his journey on the hit competition show came to a close, making some rather controversial decisions as a member of the&nbsp;Kentucky House of Representatives, one of which occurred on Tuesday (January 16). Keep scrolling to see for yourself…</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Nick-Wilson-1.png><p data-characters=345 data-current-count=645 data-injectable=true>Nick Wilson recently received quite a bit of backlash after filing a bill that would have legalized sexual intercourse in between first cousins on Tuesday (January 16), later deeming the decision to be a mistake. According to the Kentucky General Assembly’s website, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he withdrew the bill</a>&nbsp;the same day, however the damage was already done.</p><p data-characters=100 data-current-count=100 data-injectable=false>Because of this, Nick took to Facebook to apologize, as well as explain his initial thought process:</p><p>“I filed HB 269 yesterday. The purpose of the bill is to add ‘sexual contact’ to the incest statute. Currently, incest only applies in cases of intercourse. So sexual touching/groping by uncles, stepdads or anyone with a familial relationship is not included in incest. My bill makes that kind of sexual contact a Class D Felony, unless the victim is under the age of 12, then it increases the penalty to a Class C Felony. During the drafting process, there was an inadvertent change, which struck ‘first cousins’ from the list of relationships included under the incest statute, and I failed to add it back in. During today’s session, I will withdraw HB 269 and refile a bill with the ‘first cousin’ language intact.”</p><p data-characters=39 data-current-count=39 data-injectable=false>The two-time Survivor player concluded:</p><p>“This is a bill to combat a problem of familial and cyclical abuse that transcends generations of Kentuckians. I understand that I made a mistake, but I sincerely hope my mistake doesn’t hurt the chances of the corrected version of the bill. It is a good bill, and I hope it will get a second chance.”</p><p data-characters=239 data-current-count=596 data-injectable=true>This is not the first time one of his decisions has been under fire, previously supporting SB 150 in March of 2023, which banned gender-affirming care for transgender youth, which was ultimately viewed as dangerous to the LGBTQ+ community.</p><p data-characters=261 data-current-count=261 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, to see Nick Wilson’s journey to becoming the “Sole Survivor” and securing the million-dollar cash prize, fans can stream Survivor: David vs Goliath (as well as the other 44 seasons of the hit competition show) via Paramount Plus.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlnp6wrHnWoqOsp55is7O7zGaqrqqmnsOwvoydmK%2BhlGLDtHnGqKOimaSdeqK6w2auobFdnsButMRmqqhlk6S7tb7Or5yrq5mWuXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
