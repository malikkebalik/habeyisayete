As a college student, Holmes joined a punk rock band as well as the improv comedy troupe The Sweaty-Toothed Madmen. With the encouragement of his mother, Pete initially planned on becoming a youth pastor before deciding to become a comedian, and he told CNN in 2019, "I sort of joke that they both like public speaking, right? And certainly the type of comedy I'm doing, I would like everyone to leave feeling less afraid and less alone. I think she wanted me to be a youth pastor because I talked about the tumult in my family. I was always calming the family down or trying to keep a fight from happening. I think my mom recognized that I liked people to be happy. I like people to get along. And I like to be a peacemaker. And I liked the church. So she was like, you should be a youth pastor." After failing to find success as a comedian in Massachusetts, Holmes moved to Sleepy Hollow, New York, followed by Chicago and Los Angeles.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-230383 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Pete-Holmes-e1589743492541.jpg alt="Pete Holmes" width=378 height=386 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-230383 class=wp-caption-text>Nicholas Hunt/Getty Images</p><h2 id=career><strong>Career</strong></h2><p>In the early days of his comedy career, Pete was involved in the Christian comedy circuit, and he performed on Comedy Central's "Premium Blend" in 2005.
