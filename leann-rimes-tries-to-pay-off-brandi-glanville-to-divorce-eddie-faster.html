She would even “elope” with him, if only his divorce would come through (and if only he would, you know, propose to her). I theorized at the time that LeAnn would probably get pregnant right around the time Eddie’s divorce from Brandi Glanville was being finalized, and that LeAnn and Eddie would probably have a shotgun wedding. Which, honestly, is what I would do if I was in LeAnn’s shoes and I really wanted to marry Eddie. A little shotgun wedding never hurt anybody.</p><p>Anyway, the Enquirer is reporting this week that LeAnn’s got ants in her pants about getting this sh-t nailed down with Eddie – so much so that she’s offering to pay off Brandi to speed things up:</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/8/f/3/7/LeAnn_Rimes_Makes_ec31.jpg width=500 height=794 border=0 alt="LeAnn Rimes Makes Her Way to Sundance!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p>LeAnn Rimes wants to be a summer bride – and she’s not letting the fact that Eddie Cibrian is still married stand in her way!</p><p>LeAnn is so eager to fast-track a wedding to Eddie that she’s offered to tap into her $35 million fortune to bankroll a divorce payoff to his estranged wife, sources say.</p><p>“She’s already talking to dress designers, and she’s telling friends that wants a sunset wedding in Malibu in July or August,” an insider revealed. LeAnn’s divorce from Dean Sheremet is set to be finalized June 19.</p><p>However, Brandi is still bitter over being dumped by the 36-year-old actor, and the two continue to bicker over custody issues involving their two youngest sons.</p><p>“Brandi doesn’t have any incentive to tie up loose ends with Eddie, and she’s getting a kick out of seeing him and LeAnn squirm,” said the source.</p><p>“LeAnn told Eddie that she’s willing to fork over a few million dollars to him for Brandi if she agrees to cut him loose quickly,” the insider divulged. “LeAnn is ready to start a new life with Eddie.”</p><p>[From The National Enquirer, print edition]</p><p>I totally believe this. All of it. I believe that LeAnn wants to get this stuff done ASAP. I believe LeAnn is offering Eddie (Brandi, really) a lot of money to end this, and I believe Brandi gets a kick out of doing whatever she can to c-ckblock LeAnn. And I have to admit, it’s kind of funny. I think Brandi is a scorned ex-wife who put up with multiple dalliances by Eddie, and this is the way she has fun now, seeing how she can screw over LeAnn and Eddie. So, will Brandi take the money? Or will she make LeAnn suffer even more? I think Brandi should hold out a little longer, see how much she can squeeze out of LeAnn. I mean, how high will LeAnn’s offer go? Brandi should hold out for a cool $5 million. And if she gets that, she should take it and then move on with her life.</p><p>Here’s Brandi, enjoying herself. I really think Brandi is so pretty:</p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/6/4/a/4/Brandi_Glanville_Heats_798f.jpg width=500 height=364 border=0 alt="Brandi Glanville Heats Up A Ralphs!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.picapp.com/ftp/Images/4/d/c/a/Brandi_Glanville_Heats_792a.jpg width=500 height=688 border=0 alt="Brandi Glanville Heats Up A Ralphs!" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmcm5lbn1wuMSapaeXop66pr%2B%2BraminaOUwbCrz5qwmKeWm6yjvsCnm6KXl6Gur8LIpaOel6SkrKW11aipnJ2PmrGltcSYnZqrpJq%2FcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
