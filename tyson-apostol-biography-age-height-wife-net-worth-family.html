Early on, Apostol wanted to blindside fellow contestant Erinn Lobdell; however, he eventually sided with the majority and voted out the ill <a href=#>Jerry Sims</a>. At the merge, Apostol won the first individual immunity by outlasting former tribemate Debbie Beebe. He went on to win immunity again with nine contestants left as well. Wade and Apostol aligned with <a href=#>Stephen Fishbach</a>, James "J.T." Thomas, Jr., and Beebe, blindsiding <a href=#>Brendan Synnott</a> with the cooperation of Lobdell and Tamara "Taj" Johnson-George. <a href=#>Sierra Reed</a> became the target, but Thomas, Lobdell, and Fishbach joined the other group, deciding that Apostol was a bigger threat than Reed; Apostol was voted out and became the second juror. He eventually voted for Thomas to win the game.</p><p>Apostol proposed to his girlfriend of six and a half years, Rachel Foulger, during the finale of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars 2. The episode aired on March 13, 2015. On March 15, 2015, Apostol and Foulger confirmed that in the time since filming Marriage Boot Camp, they had gotten married. Apostol's Survivor: Tocantins co-star, <a href=#>Stephen Fishbach</a>, performed the private ceremony on February 8, 2015 in Utah.</p><p>Foulger and Apostol have two daughters, born in 2015 and 2018.</p><p>Apostol accepted an offer to participate again, in the show's 20th season, where he was assigned to the Villains tribe. His tribe dominated the initial immunity challenges. He formed an alliance with <a href=#>Jerri Manthey</a> and fellow Tocantins participant Benjamin "Coach" Wade. Apostol appeared to be safe after joining the alliance of "Boston Rob" Mariano, <a href=#>Sandra Diaz-Twine</a>, and <a href=#>Courtney Yates</a>, along with Wade and Manthey. This group held a majority over the bloc of <a href=#>Russell Hantz</a>, <a href=#>Parvati Shallow</a>, and <a href=#>Danielle DiLorenzo</a>. When both the Heroes and Villains tribes had to vote someone out consecutively, Mariano directed his alliance to split their votes due to Hantz's possession of a hidden immunity idol. The plan was to have him, Mariano and Diaz-Twine vote to eliminate Hantz and Yates, Manthey and Wade vote to eliminate Shallow. If Hantz gave Shallow the idol or if Hantz did not play the idol at all, on the revote, Hantz would be eliminated. If Hantz played the idol for himself, on the revote, Shallow would be eliminated. Hantz manipulated Apostol into disobeying Mariano's plan, and instead of forcing a tie, Apostol switched his vote to Shallow. After Hantz gave Shallow the hidden immunity idol and she played it, Apostol was eliminated by a vote of 3–2, with Hantz's idol negating four votes against Shallow.</p><p>Had Apostol voted along Mariano's plan, he and Hantz would have tied 3–3, and Hantz would have been eliminated on the revote. Thus Apostol was the sixth survivor and the second Villain to be voted out of the season. His switching votes has been called "one of the dumbest moves in Survivor history." His vote switch caused huge ramifications on the game as Hantz would make it all the way to the Final Tribal Council.</p><p>Tyson Apostol (born June 17, 1979) is an American reality television personality, best known for his appearances on multiple seasons of the CBS reality television show Survivor. Apostol originally competed on Survivor: Tocantins in 2009, finishing in 8th place. He returned as a villain on Survivor: Heroes vs. Villains in 2010 and came in 15th place. In 2013, he returned again and was eventually crowned the winner of Survivor: Blood vs. Water. Apostol competed for a fourth time on the show's 40th season Survivor: Winners at War, finishing in 11th place.</p><p>Apostol was born in Provo, Utah, on June 17, 1979. He was raised in Lindon, Utah, and currently lives in Mesa, Arizona. He is a bike shop owner and has cycled professionally in Switzerland, Belgium, and Austria, most notably riding for the Austrian professional continental team, Team Volksbank between 2005 and 2007.</p><p>Apostol once again came back for the show's 40th season, Winners at War. He was a member of the Dakal tribe. He was targeted by Yul Kwon early in the game for having close ties with other players outside the game, such as <a href=#>Rob Mariano</a> and Kim Spradlin-Wolfe. After Dakal lost the fifth immunity challenge, Apostol became the fifth person voted off and went to the Edge of Extinction. He rejoined the game at the merge after winning the return challenge against the other Edge of Extinction contestants. However, Apostol was voted off again on day 25 and returned to the Edge of Extinction. He was defeated in the second return challenge by <a href=#>Natalie Anderson</a>, for whom he later voted to win the season, though she would lose to Tyson's former Dakal tribemate <a href=#>Tony Vlachos</a>, who would win the season and become the second ever two time winner in Survivor.</p><p>Apostol returned for Survivor' s 27th season, Blood vs. Water. This time, he and his longtime girlfriend, Rachel Foulger, were both cast as contestants. He was assigned to the Galang tribe, while she went to Tadhana. Foulger was the fourth person eliminated from the game after being the second contestant to be voted out in a Tribal Council.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmsmZeaxKq3yGeaqKVfqca0u81mmKmno6m8rQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
