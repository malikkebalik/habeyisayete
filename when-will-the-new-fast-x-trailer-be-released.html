Fast X is the tenth film in the Fast and Furious series and the second-to-last film in the franchise before Dominic Toretto and company’s journey is declared complete, therefore the timing is hardly coincidental. Diesel’s Instagram posts suggested a Super Bowl release date, but it appears Universal passed on the opportunity, possibly to avoid competing with the trailer for DC’s The Flash, which has already been scheduled to air on that Sunday."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Now, while the major trailer won’t air until after the Super Bowl, Fast X will still have a TV spot air on the night of the event that may serve as a teaser for the entire trailer.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Fast-X-Trailer.jpg><p>It’s hardly surprising that Fast X would continue some sort of promotion on the Super Bowl date, given that F9’s initial trailer debuted during the game and was instrumental in reviving the movie industry after the epidemic. It’s hardly unexpected that a lengthy trailer is required to introduce new cast members like <a href=# rel=noopener>Brie Larson</a> and Jason Momoa in this installment of the Fast and Furious franchise.</p><p><strong>If you want to check out more latest movies then you can check out the below posts:</strong></p><p>In addition to these stars, several more from the previous films return for Fast X as well, including Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludacris, Sun Kang, <a href=# rel=noopener>Jordana Brewster</a>, Jason Statham, Charlize Theron, Helen Mirren, and John Cena.
