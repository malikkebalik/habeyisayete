I mean, I never really believed in Gwyneth or her message, but I enjoyed seeing her struggle to talk down to the peasants and try to make their lives more like hers. But these days, Gwyneth’s Goop-letters have been so… I can’t put my finger on it. They’re just paid advertisements for all of the fancy places she prefers, or they’re advertising for her various gurus and snake-oil salesmen. This week’s Goop-letter is all about the Hamptons, which is where Gwyneth summers annually. She usually “takes off” for the month of August. As in, there are no Goop-letters for about five weeks while she’s on vacation. You don’t even know how hard she works though. The struggle of her life, the difficulties she faces talking down to people and deigning to recommend the perfect blow-dry bar in the Hamptons.</p><p>Anyway, in a brilliant stroke of cross-promotion, Page Six says that Gwyneth is already in the Hamptons… with Chris Martin.</p><p>Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin’s “conscious recoupling” continues. The pair, who announced their separation in March, have been spotted together numerous times in the Hamptons this week.</p><p>Chris and Gwyneth dined with their children at Bay Kitchen Bar on Monday evening‎ in East Hampton. Then on Tuesday, Chris dropped into sports store Gubbins to pick up skateboards before heading to meet Gwyneth and their kids Apple and Moses at nearby Fierro’s Pizza.</p><p>One witness said, “They were operating like a couple, and with the kids looked like a happy family.”</p><p>It’s been speculated that a reconciliation could be in the works. People magazine recently reported, “They haven’t made any concrete decision to get back together yet, but clearly it’s a possibility ... some of the pressure was just taken off.”</p><p><a href=#>[From Page Six]</a></p><p>So, it’s happening. Chris came back to her. She gave him the space to figure out his sh-t and he came back to her. Does this make her more smug? Does she get to give interviews about how she has it all figured out and that she’s great at giving relationship advice? Here’s the thing: while I think she has every right to feel smug that Chris has returned to her, I don’t believe that much of the past year was on her terms. And I still don’t think her marriage is on her terms. I think Chris has done whatever (and whoever) he wanted and he will continue to do so.</p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/goop12.jpg alt=goop1 width=510 sizes="(max-width: 610px) 100vw, 610px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p><a href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.celebitchy.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/goop22.jpg alt=goop2 width=512 sizes="(max-width: 612px) 100vw, 612px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>Photos courtesy of <a href=#>Gwyneth’s IG</a>, Fame/Flynet.<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmirJOdxm%2BvzqZmbG9lboV2e8awsKedpJ2ssa3Lramor4%2BnsqS71KmjnpyPrLa1tL6cn6uho5S6or7ToqWYoZ6UwamxvqGYpqikpLu0q8KrpqyrXaW%2FsLnOraCopl8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
