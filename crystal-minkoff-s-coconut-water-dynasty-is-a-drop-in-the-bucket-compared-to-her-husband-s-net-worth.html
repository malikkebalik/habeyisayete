The new season saw the addition of two cast members <a href=#>Kathy Hilton</a> (Paris Hilton’s mother) and Minkoff.</p><p id=par-4_50>Producers announced that Minkoff would be joining the show in October 2020 as a Housewife. Hilton first joined the show as a ‘Friend of the Housewives.’ Minkoff’s addition to the elite group came after Denise Richards and Teddi Mellencamp Arroyave announced that they wouldn’t be returning for the eleventh season.</p><p id=par-5_53>This season follows Kyle Richards, Lisa Rinna, Erika Girardi, Dorit Kemsley and Garcelle Beauvais. Garcelle was the first Black cast member in RHOBH, and Minkoff became the first Asian American Housewife on the show. The two new cast members have made the show the first diverse show in the Real Housewives franchise yet.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-crystal-minkoff-s-net-worth><strong>What is Crystal Minkoff’s</strong> net worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_59>The fact that Minkoff is part of the Real Housewives means that she must be somewhat loaded. Aside from being a Housewife, Minkoff has a thriving business. She is the co-founder of a beverage company called Real Coco, a company she started with her brother Jeffrey Kung. The company sells premium organic beverages, and all its products are plant-based.</p><p id=par-7_74>Real Coco hasn’t been around for a long time, but it seems to be doing just fine. The brand sells various products such as organic coconut milk, coconut chips, organic coffee creamer variations, and organic coconut water variations. The products fall within the range of $29 to $42, as reported by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Heavy</a>. Minkoff isn’t the only Housewife to have launched a water brand. Kelly Dodd became part owner of Positive Beverage late last year.</p><p id=par-8_46>Minkoff’s husband Rob has been involved with various successful productions. He directed the 1994 Lion King movie, which grossed more than $900 million in the box office. He has also worked on Stuart Little 1 and Stuart Little 2 and The Mr. Peabody and Sherman Show.</p><p id=par-9_26>Although the exact figure of the new RHOBH cast member isn’t readily available, sources estimate her and her husband’s <a href=#>combined net worth</a> to be $16 million.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-minkoff-s-mansion-has-significant-meaning-to-her><strong>Minkoff’s mansion has significant meaning to her</strong></h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_44>The Housewives are known for having huge houses and living affluent lifestyles, and Minkoff seems to be fitting right at home. The businesswoman revealed in an interview that she and her producer/director husband built their mansion themselves, calling it “a total labor of love.”</p><p id=par-11_58>The couple’s Beverly Hills mansion is about 9000 square feet and has been shown numerous times in the show. Minkoff stated that she wanted a home that was 8888 square feet since the number 8 has significant importance to Chinese culture. Although they didn’t find exactly what they were looking for, they cut in close with their home.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FqbvBoWScqqmowaK4jKagp6Ofm7O0ecKomqimpal6uK3TnqlmnKmjrrTA2GagrGWUp7yxecinZJutk6CytXnCqKSpmaKasW601KyZmqaUqHqvsdNmrqiqpJ17qcDMpWY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
