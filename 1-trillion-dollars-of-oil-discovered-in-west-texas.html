The estimated 20 billion barrels are valued at up to $900 billion. At three times the size of the Bakken Oilfields in North Dakota, it could be the largest deposit in the United States.

Our means of transportation is especially dependent on it, until a strong revolution in production takes place.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-208999 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GettyImages-81705896.jpg alt="TO GO WITH AFP STORY: Commodities-oil-energy-price-US-boom-crime, Oilfield thefts on rise in Texas amid booming prices by Mira Oberman. This June 24, 2008 photo shows oil drilling rigs in Midland County, Texas. The wide open oilfields of West Texas are ripe pickings for thieves these days. Some drive up to one of the thousands of pump jacks that dot the countryside and siphon crude out of the storage tanks. Some pull up to a drill site after the crews have gone for the night and haul away tools, pipes and equipment. Others take kickbacks, file false invoices or just plain steal knowing their bosses are too busy riding the oil boom to keep a close eye on accounting.

All of the oil underneath Texas is recoverable and usable, with nothing stopping the federal government from extracting it. They will most likely use the controversial fracking method, which has been linked to localized earthquakes in Oklahoma.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>While 20 billion barrels sounds like a lot of oil, we currently use around 1,200 barrels per second out of a total of 1.14 trillion barrels existing on the planet. Other major oil fields often have larger challenges due to&nbsp;steep development costs or government sanctions, such as the 33 billion gallon Carioca-Sugar Loaf off the shore of Brazil, or the 31 billion gallon Ferdows, Mound, and Zagheh fields off the coast of Iran.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The additional 20 billion would give us just 193 additional days of burning and consuming oil before we run out in around 37 years. Hopefully, by then, we'll have that energy revolution.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLTOsGSmrZOdeqW7xKxmamWkp7atuMiopWacn6G5or7SZqaipF2ZtrSvzq%2Bcq52UYsSmv9Nmq56wkah8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
