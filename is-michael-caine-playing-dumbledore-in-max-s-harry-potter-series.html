As everyone and their mothers leave their two cents on the subject, many others have been left wondering <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">about the casting for the upcoming series</a>, and whether or not Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rubert Grint will respire their roles. Perhaps more importantly, it appears that Dumbledore is already getting an unofficial casting by DiscussingFilm and it is none other than Sir Michael Caine.</p><p data-characters=2 data-current-count=2 data-injectable=false></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=302 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Michael Caine will play Albus Dumbledore in MAX‚Äôs ‚ÄòHARRY POTTER‚Äô series.</p><p>(Source: <a href=#>@DEADLINE</a>) <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/9xRPFQVQS7</a></p>‚Äî DisbussingFilm (@DisbussingFilm) <a href=#>April 13, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=574 data-current-count=876 data-injectable=true>The DiscussingFilm riff account has hardly any backing source to its claims, making it fairly obvious that this is not a real announcement. Nonetheless, the hoax has been met with plenty of fans almost excited about this near-perfect casting. While Caine would undoubtedly prove to be the perfect Dumbledore capable of bringing magic into any household, the actor is 90 years old, and though his talent has not ceased with age, the Harry Potter series is expected to last for at least seven seasons ‚Äî which would be almost unfeasible for anyone nearing a century of life.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>I know this is disbussing film but that's good casting.</p>‚Äî Slicedude (@Slicetweeter784) <a href=#>April 13, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Michael Caine?

Naturally, beggars can‚Äôt be choosers, but Cox might as well be the winning horse in the race, with the perfect age and acting expertise to perfectly portray the beloved white-bearded professor. As for Pratt ‚Äî maybe his hands are just a bit too full with Super Mario Bros. and with saving the universe from aliens and the like ‚Äî so it‚Äôs best to let it pass.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>Brian Cox or nothing <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/zjAxGI9UUg</a></p>‚Äî Prakhar PaliwalüêÄ (@NotGeekingOut) <a href=#>April 13, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>No, Chris Pratt should play it</p>‚Äî David Austin Thompson (Clark Kent Era) (@Davey2356) <a href=#>April 13, 2023</a></figure><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><p lang=en dir=ltr>hear me out but morgan freeman</p>‚Äî sam (@SecretWeapnEcho) <a href=#>April 13, 2023</a></figure><p data-characters=205 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=false>The upcoming controversial series has currently no released information on its cast, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">as well as of its premiere date</a>, but one thing is for certain ‚Äî <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the hype and discussion will not die out anytime soon</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3yqv4ymoJygkZq5bq%2FAoqWeZaChrrq1zaBkna2dl7mmsM6rnGahnmK6osTSZp%2BaqqKuerG7062cq2Wjmr%2BqsdJo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
