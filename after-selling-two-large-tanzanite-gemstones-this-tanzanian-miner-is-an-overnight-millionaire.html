CNBC reports that after mining two of the largest Tanzanite gemstones ever found in the region, Laizer has sold the <a href=#>gems</a> for 7.7 billion Tanzanian shillings – or about $3.4 million in American dollars.</p><p>Weighing in at 9.2kg and 5.8kg, the stones were mined by Laizer about a week before he sold them at a trading event in Manyara. As for what he intends to do as a new millionaire (and, in his own country's currency, a billionaire), Laizer told the BBC about some of his big plans, which include a shopping mall and a school all in his hometown of Simanjiro in Manyara. He went on:</p><p><strong>"I want to build this school near my home…There are many poor people around here who can't afford to take their children to school…I am not educated but I like things run in a professional way. So I would like my children to run the business professionally."</strong></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-303249 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GettyImages-1222767162.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-303249 class=wp-caption-text>FILBERT RWEYEMAMU/AFP via Getty Images</p><p>Laizer is evidently going to quit the mining business now that he's struck it rich, but he does intend to continue looking after another of his businesses: a herd of about 2,000 cows. One of those cows, he says, will be the main course at a "big party" he's planning to throw to celebrate his new wealth.</p><p>Among those reported to have congratulated Laizer on his success is Tanzanian President John Magufuli, who gave him a phone call and has said that Laizer's story shows the value of small-scale mining and "proves that Tanzania is rich."</p><p>As you can probably figure out from the name, Tanzanite is a rare mineral that can only be found within the borders of Tanzania, and in fact the mining area where it's known to exist covers only a few miles.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcLTOsGSmrZOdeqW7xKxmmp6kmr9uv8Slo6Kml2LBuLuMpZirn5ViwaK62ZqloqyVYrSmudKtpqedo2LBqbXSZquapqqWu6qtzWakoqaVp3qqv4yapWanppq%2Fr7XGoatmpZmhuaq7zZqgq51f</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
