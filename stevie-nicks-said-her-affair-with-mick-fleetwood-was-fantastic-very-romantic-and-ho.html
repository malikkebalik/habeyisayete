It’s not hard to figure out what happened – and what happened wasn’t a good thing. It was doomed.

It had its month of glory, which was fantastic and very romantic, and then when we got back to LA it was not romantic any more, it was horrifying. It should never have happened.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-the-singer-said-she-wrote-the-song-sara-about-her-romance-with-the-fleetwood-mac-drummer>The singer said she wrote the song ‘Sara’ about her romance with the Fleetwood Mac drummer</h2><p id=par-8_14>Stevie Nicks wrote the Fleetwood Mac song “Sara” about her affair with Mick Fleetwood.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_53>“Sara was pretty much about Mick. So, he was the ‘great dark wing,’” Nicks told MTV Fanatic in 1998 (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">In Her Own Words</a>). “And, ah, it was about everything that was going on at that particular time, too, but he was the, the reason for the, you know, the beginning of it.”</p><p id=par-10_76>Nicks has also said that there is an extended version of the song that fans have never heard. The lyrics contain more of the personal story. “Sara [is my most personal song], it’s about myself, and what all of us in Fleetwood Mac were going through at the time,” she reportedly told Us Magazine in July 1990. “The true version of that song is 16 minutes long. It’s a saga with many verses people haven’t heard.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTAtbHVopxmppmYuLR50pqgnWWRm7OitdFmpKKbm2KzrbHEra6op5Ris6K605qqraGTYr%2BwucCnq6KbXZ28s77In7CippdjtbW5y2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
