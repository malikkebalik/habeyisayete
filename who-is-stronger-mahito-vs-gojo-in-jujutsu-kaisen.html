The stakes are often very high and the risk of death looms over the characters’ heads, which contributes to driving viewers to the edge of their seats. Even a mini flashback arc like the Hidden Inventory was a treat that showcased the new animation style through riveting fight sequences with some surprising twists and turns.</p><p data-characters=565 data-current-count=565 data-injectable=true>You could also ask Jujutsu Kaisen fans for who they think the strongest character is and the responses will mostly stay coherent between just a handful of characters. If you were to ask the overwhelming majority of the characters in the series, they’d say that, with no room for doubt, the strongest man alive is <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Satoru Gojo</a>. If you were to ask the man himself, Gojo would tell you with little to no hesitation, that he is indeed <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">the strongest</a>. He makes a point of saying it early on in the series and certainly has the skill to back up his unshakable confidence.</p><p data-characters=96 data-current-count=96 data-injectable=false>But how would the cursed Mahito fare against the holder of the Six Eyes and Limitless technique?</p><h2 id=h-would-mahito-stand-a-chance data-injectable=false>Would Mahito stand a chance?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Design-sem-nome-30.png><p data-characters=174 data-current-count=570 data-injectable=true>The answer is: most likely not. In fact, Gojo could wipe the floor with Mahito. The real question is how long could Mahito last by himself against the special-grade sorcerer.</p><p data-characters=381 data-current-count=381 data-injectable=false>On Reddit, three different posts ranking the most powerful Jujutsu Kaisen characters always place the same people in either first or second place: Gojo or Sukuna (with all 20 fingers). In only <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">one of these ranking lists</a> does Mahito make it to the top 10, and he’s placed in eighth place along with Jogo, whom Gojo easily beat without even breaking a sweat in Season 1, Episode 7.</p><p data-characters=524 data-current-count=905 data-injectable=true>If Mahito managed to last even 20 minutes by himself, it would be an unbelievable feat as that is what Hanami, Jogo, and Choso attempted to accomplish in the early stages of the Shibuya Incident Arc, and Mahito would definitely not be able to take on these three at the same time on his own. Not to mention, if need be, Gojo can limit his highly destructive techniques so they don’t harm the civilians around him and still kick the butt of Mahito’s team. Remember what he did to poor Miguel in Jujutsu Kaisen 0?</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><p data-characters=426 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=false>Even if the sadistic curse were to use his Self-Embodiment of Perfection domain, Gojo could easily use his Unlimited Void and overwhelm Mahito, very much like he did to Jogo earlier on in the series. Mahito’s transfiguration techniques can be truly frightening and disturbing, but there just aren’t that many sorcerers or cursed spirits that could ever hope to measure up to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Gojo</a>, he’s on a level of his own.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn6hlmah6tMDRqKWgnaJiuqK0yK2mZq6jYrSwts5moKdlmqq3tsDSrmSkmZmosq97</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
