I remember the feeling of quitting that job and realising, ‘Wow, I’m only doing music now – maybe not what I want to be doing, but I can pay my rent and eat.’ I was 22 and it felt incredible,” she said.</p><p id=par-9_20>She went on to describe the first time she had the opportunity to freely spend one of her paychecks.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-10_77>“When I got signed to Warner Chappell as a songwriter and I got my first advance, I splurged on travel to Australia. I was dating a guy there and I remember just being able to buy the plane ticket spontaneously and that was a really cool feeling,” she told GQ. “It was still economy, middle seat and, like, four flights, but it was a big deal at the time.
