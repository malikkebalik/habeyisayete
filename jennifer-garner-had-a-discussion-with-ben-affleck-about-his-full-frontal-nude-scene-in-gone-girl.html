The couple grew apart through the years but still have a lot of respect for each other, as they make sure to put their three children first. Now, we’re looking back before Garner and Affleck went their separate ways. Garner spoke on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ellen DeGeneres Show</a> about <a href=#>Affleck’s role in Gone Girl</a>, and Ellen DeGeneres questioned Garner about Affleck’s full-frontal nude scenes.</p><p id=par-3_23>“Can we talk about Gone Girl for a second?” DeGeneres said. “Because maybe the reason it’s No. 1 is because he’s showing ….”</p><p id=par-4_33>“His penis,” Garner finished. “I think you’re probably on to something. What I have to say is, you’re welcome. I try to consider myself a charitable person. And I wanted to give back.”</p><p id=par-5_29>DeGeneres asked Garner if either she or Affleck was “nervous” about the full-frontal scene, as this was the first time Affleck had shown so much nudity in a film.</p><p id=par-6_48>“Yeah, it was a discussion,” Garner said. “It was like, ‘Hey, you know, at work today, Fincher talked me into coming out of the shower.’ I was like, ‘Oh, cool. Well, I hope he had on a wide lens.'” The audience laughed at Garner’s impersonation of her then-husband.</p><p id=par-7_16>“If you’re gonna go there, Ellen, you have to go all the way there,” she added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-he-joked-about-what-his-wife-thought-of-his-gone-girl-role>He joked about what his wife thought of his ‘Gone Girl’ role</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Jennifer-Garner-Ben-Affleck-2.webp?strip=all&quality=80"><p id=par-8_48>In Gone Girl, Ben Affleck played a man whose wife framed him for her alleged murder. He joked to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a> that playing Nick Dunne offered him “the killer role of a lifetime.” He also commented on how it made Jennifer Garner feel to take on the role.</p><p id=par-9_14>“I think Jen knows I’m not a murderer by now,” he said. “I hope!”</p><p id=par-10_108>As for the nudity, Affleck was warned by director David Fincher that he’d have to bare it all. “Director David [Fincher] said to me from the beginning, ‘This is a warts and all movie. It can have no vanity. You have to see the naked underbelly of this character,'” Affleck explained to MTV&nbsp;News’ Josh Horowitz at the time. “It’s gotta be like in Europe. They just don’t give a s*** about any of that stuff, and they just play real people. So, that was the spirit of the thing, and we kind of stuck to that, me and&nbsp;Rosamund&nbsp;[Pike]. There is some brief, um, very brief nudity, I think.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-jennifer-garner-is-allegedly-helping-ben-affleck-sort-through-his-issues-with-jennifer-lopez-in-2024>Jennifer Garner is allegedly helping Ben Affleck sort through his issues with Jennifer Lopez in 2024</h2><p id=par-11_55>Jennifer Garner isn’t talking about Ben Affleck’s nudity in 2024. While she tries to keep her private life away from the media, Affleck and Jennifer Lopez are all over the news for their alleged marital troubles. Several sources suggest Garner helps Affleck with his marriage issues and hopes he can work it out with Lopez.</p><p id=par-12_39>“She wants him happy and healthy so he can be the best dad possible,” a source told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People</a>. The source added that Garner “likes that [Lopez] lives a healthy lifestyle and supports Ben’s sobriety. Jen wants that for Ben.”</p><p id=par-13_13>For more on the entertainment world and exclusive interviews, follow&nbsp;<a href=#>Showbiz Cheat Sheet’s Instagram</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS3prrNop2eql2crrO6xKtknaGjmMK0v8iopWaalaN6orLFpZyco12bwq24jJ%2BpqKaklrluutSdnGark5q7pnnGqKWeZZeev616x62kpWc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
