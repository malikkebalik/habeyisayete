The foundation works to teach kids about science, technology, engineering,&nbsp;and math.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Some of the top items available include Abdul-Jabbar's four championship rings he won with the Los Angeles Lakers and an autographed and inscribed ball from his final game. The Hall of Famer is also auctioning off game-worn jerseys, uniforms, trophies, and keys to cities that he received throughout his career.</span></p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-278104 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/GettyImages-497361530.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-278104 class=wp-caption-text>Rachel Murray/Getty Images for Thelonious Monk Institute of Jazz</p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Abdul-Jabbar explained in a post on his blog that he's not selling the items due to any financial trouble. Rather, his decision stems on his ability to impact others.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>"So, when it comes to choosing between storing a championship ring or trophy in a room, or providing kids with an opportunity to change their lives, the choice is pretty simple. Sell it all," he wrote. "Looking back on what I have done with my life, instead of gazing at the sparkle of jewels or gold plating celebrating something I did a long time ago, I'd rather look into the delighted face of a child holding their first caterpillar and think about what I might be doing for their future. That's a history that has no price."</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Want to make a bid? You can view the memorabilia available at </span><a href=#><span style=font-weight:400>Goldin Auctions</span></a><span style=font-weight:400> – but it might get pricey. Abdul Jabbar's 1985 championship ring has a minimum bid of $65,000; several other&nbsp;lots are going for tens of thousands of dollars. A handful of items can be had for less than $1,000, though, including plaques, certificates, and sculptures.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqSYq52VonqirsOuo2aikZevor6MoqpmmaWYwaq7zaKloGWfm7Nuv86mnGanlmK1qr%2BMppymp6KWr6q4yJpkm62kYruwwIybnJyZpaiybrTErGSbqp%2BgsnA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
