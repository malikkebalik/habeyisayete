From my perspective, it’s best that they continue to keep their relationship a secret. I find it quite annoying that a year after the breakup, there are still annoying fans complaining about it and demanding answers or recommending that the two get back together.</p><p>One other option is to spit on Jamie since it’s quite unlikely that Skyler was the cause of the breakup. I’m not implying that he was; I’m just saying it’s frustrating that everyone seems to be against Jamie and assumes the problem is her fault while treating Skyler as though he’s great.</p><p><strong>If you want to check out more celebrities’ divorces you can check out the below articles:</strong></p><h2>How Many Children Do Jamie and Skyler Have?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Jamie-and-Skyler-kids.jpg><p>A total of nine people now make up the Scott family.
