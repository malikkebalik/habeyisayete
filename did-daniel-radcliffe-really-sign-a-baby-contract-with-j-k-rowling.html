Recommended Videos Thanks to a viral video on TikTok purporting the former promised the latter his firstborn child (yes, you read that correctly), the pair have found themselves entangled in ways neither could have likely predicted. Over 2.2 million people have viewed the video, uploaded by TikTok user @bullsnosenews, with more than a few having taken to the comments section to inquire about its legitimacy."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The author has spent the last half-decade fighting off accusations of transphobia — accusations which originated after she vehemently doubled down on assertions that sex is real, transgender women should not have the same rights as biological women, and that gender-affirming care for transgender youth should be avoided, not encouraged.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=397 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>The pair’s paths converged once more in April 2023 after Warner Bros.

Rowling the rights to his firstborn child when he signed his Harry Potter contract at age 10.</p><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=514 data-injectable=true>Now that Radcliffe is expecting his first child with Darke, @bullsnosenews claims that Rowling is adamant Radcliffe hand over what was promised. However, because Radcliffe was a minor when he signed the contract, @bullsnosenews states the actor is reluctant to follow through.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=259 data-current-count=259 data-injectable=false>The video then goes on to say that Rowling will “come for the child either way” and that Radcliffe must honor the contract he signed. “My contracts are iron tight. Not even love will protect this child,” says Rowling according to @bullsnosenews.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=195 data-current-count=454 data-injectable=true>When asked how Radcliffe would protect his child from the author, the actor said, “I don’t know. Probably just say it is trans or something. That’ll disarm her, I reckon. Expelliarmus.”&nbsp;</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Is there any truth to the rumor?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/TikTok-bullsnosenews.png><p data-characters=278 data-current-count=578 data-injectable=true>In the age of the internet, it can be difficult to know what is true and what is false. More often than not, false information is spread either unknowingly or intentionally. Other times, though, it’s all just fun and games with no serious intent. Enter: parody accounts.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=231 data-current-count=231 data-injectable=false>Parody accounts tend to have disclaimers attached to their profile bios, as is the case with @bullsnosenews. “Here Lies The Truth, News You Can Trust,” the account bio reads. And then right underneath that, “Satire/Parody.”</p><p data-characters=228 data-current-count=459 data-injectable=true>It takes only a single glance at the comments section of the video to see that the wool hasn’t been completely pulled over the public’s eyes, though. Some clearly understand it to be satirical, but others, not so much.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=83 data-current-count=83 data-injectable=false>“I genuinely can’t tell if this is real or not,” wrote one TikTok user.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=133 data-current-count=216 data-injectable=false>“Literally had to look this up to confirm cause everything is on fire n anything can be true at this point,” wrote another.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=289 data-current-count=505 data-injectable=false>To set the record straight — no, the viral video about Daniel Radcliffe signing a “baby contract” with J.K. Rowling is not real. It is nothing more than a parody post meant to entertain the masses. Radcliffe has not signed any sort of contract, nor has Rowling made demands for such.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeTmrmmrtGiq6Kdo2SxqrCMnZinoZWherOtw5yjop6WmnqzscClo7Jlo560r3nAZpmamqlisLC606uYnKxdrLa1tIyjZKRloqTErbXNoGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
