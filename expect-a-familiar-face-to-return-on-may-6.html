Now, she is <a href=#>returning for an episode</a> of The Blacklist Season 9. Samar joined the task force as an investigative agent and Mossad liaison. Eventually, she begins a romantic relationship with Aram Mojtabai.</p><p id=par-3_64>Toward the end of <a href=#>season 5</a>, Samar nearly drowned and was without oxygen for six minutes. She is placed on life support at the hospital, but Aram remains optimistic that she will recover. He even proposes to Samar and places a ring on her finger. Samar does eventually wake up and agrees to marry Aram, but the pair don’t get their happy ending.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_61>Samar develops vascular dementia as a result of her near-death experience. This caused Samar to become a target of the Osterman Umbrella Company. Samar must go into hiding and Aram insists on going with her. However, Samar flees to an undisclosed location, telling Aram on a burner phone that she couldn’t let him leave his whole life behind for her.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-samar-navabi-will-return-in-the-blacklist-season-9-episode-19>Samar Navabi will return in ‘The Blacklist’ Season 9 Episode 19</h2><p id=par-5_50>A lot has changed for Aram since Samar left him. In The Blacklist Season 9, Aram temporarily took over Cooper’s job as head of the task force, while Cooper awaits sentencing. Aram hasn’t had much of a love life since Samar left, but that might be about to change.</p><p id=par-6_67>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">E! News</a>, Mazhan Marnò will make a guest appearance as Samar in season 9 episode 19, which will air on May 6. The Blacklist Season 9 Episode 19 is titled, “The Bear Mask.” It’s one of the few episodes in season 9 that’s not named after a blacklister criminal. Usually, these episodes center on one specific character, often telling their story through flashbacks.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/The-Blacklist-Samar.jpg><p id=par-7_45><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Guide Magazine</a> wrote of the episode, “It’s Special Agent Aram Mojtabai’s turn to get a very special — and revealing — episode. Feeling stressed from his new responsibilities on the task force, he finds an unusual way to handle it. Unexpected effects ensue!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Episode 19 may include flashbacks to Aram’s experiences after Liz’s death</h2><p id=par-8_75>The Blacklist Season 9 has had several episodes that focus on one specific character’s experiences in the years following Liz Keen’s death. On March 4, Amir Arison <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tweeted</a>, “We have seen how Dembe & Ressler dealt with aftermath of Season 8 —&nbsp;The two years before we came back together for Season 9 Task Force reunion. Now we see what happened to Agent Park. We have a couple more eps of this nature this season…”</p><p id=par-9_56>It’s possible that episode 19 will have some flashbacks in store for Aram. Although viewers know that Aram started his own company after Liz died, the show hasn’t dove into how Aram emotionally dealt with Liz’s death and the task force disbanding. One thing is for sure, episode 19 is definitely going to be interesting.</p><p id=par-10_11>New episodes of&nbsp;The Blacklist&nbsp;air Fridays at 8 p.m. EST on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMm6Oam5uhtrTAjKycmqufo3p6ecSxp56bpGKzornIpaCaql2brqSxjKucra2io3qurdhmbWegpKK5cA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
