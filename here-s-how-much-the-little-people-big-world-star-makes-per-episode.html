The family is led by the matriarch, Amy, and patriarch, Matt, who both have a form of dwarfism called achondroplasia. Together the couple has four children; their oldest are fraternal twins, Jeremy and Zach. While Jeremy is of average height, Zach is a dwarf like his parents. LPBW&nbsp;has followed all the Roloff family members over the years, but Zach is the only child still filming along with his wife and their&nbsp;two children. Let’s take a closer look at <a href=#>Zach Roloff</a>‘s <a href=#>net worth</a> and how much he makes per episode on Little People, Big World.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-07d0e8b6-4f4e-4b28-a266-bef695c95c94>How much does Zach Roloff make per episode on ‘Little People, Big World’?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/tori-roloff-zach-roloff-do-for-a-living.png><p id=par-2_89>LPBW&nbsp;has filmed 22 seasons over more than a decade. With its popularity, it only makes sense that the Roloffs make fairly decent paychecks from the series. According to&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">TV Season & Spoilers</a>, the Roloffs’ individual salaries are between $30,000 to $10 million per season. Amy and Matt make the most, which makes sense because the show takes place on their farm. The children’s salaries are ample as well, though. Zach is the highest-paid Roloff child, earning $7,000 per episode. Moreover, Zach’s wife, Tori, makes between $1,500 and $3,000 per episode.</p><p id=par-3_83>Although sometimes receiving $10,000 per episode might seem like a lot, Zach and Tori have contributed significantly to the series. The couple met in 2010 when Tori was <a href=#>working pumpkin season</a> on the family farm. The couple’s first date lasted five hours, and the rest was history. Through the series, Tori and Zach have welcomed viewers into their lives as their family has grown. Today they share two children, Jackson and Lilah, and hope to only add to their clan in the future.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-2249f53b-a3ef-493f-8cd3-d76aa56f4f1c>What is Zach Roloff’s net worth?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_74>Zach and Tori definitely profit from&nbsp;LPBW, but they also bring in money from other sources. Zach helps run Matt’s pumpkin farm even when the show is not filming, and he gives&nbsp;tours of the farm, which cost $300 per person. Although he spends a lot of time on the farm, he does not live there. He and his wife bought a $600,000 house near the farm, allowing them privacy and space to raise their family.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_84>When he isn’t busy with family life or&nbsp;<a href=#>helping out on Matt’s farm</a>, Zach has continued to stay involved in his passion, soccer. When&nbsp;LPBW&nbsp;first aired, Zach was a teenager who was obsessed with soccer. He has continued to have a love for the sport into adulthood. Today, he coaches three youth soccer teams. He also played on a dwarf team himself, but this is only for fun.&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Sun</a>&nbsp;lists Zach’s net worth at $700,000 — so clearly, has plenty of money to help support his family.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=block-f34ff69d-6553-41c0-b743-668792abaa66>Tori also brings in money outside of the TLC series</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_70>Raising a growing family is hard work, and Tori has chosen to make it her top priority. She was a kindergarten teacher but took an indefinite break when she gave birth to her oldest child. Since then, Tori has started a photography business that specializes in portraits. Additionally, Tori capitalizes on her fame. Her Instagram boasts over 1 million followers. With that following, brands pay her to endorse their products.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_79>The flexibility of social media and photography allows Tori the flexibility she needs to continue raising her children. She hasn’t announced whether she will go back to teaching, but for now, the Roloffs have enough income coming in from all of their various sources to allow her to stay home. The couple have&nbsp;discussed leaving&nbsp;LPBW, which would allow for more time to pursue their respective careers — but for now, they are enjoying sharing their love story with their fans.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTHoq%2FHZqmopJ%2Bbs266xK1ksKeiqbVutM6wZKatk516rbXTraOeZaCavLG4xGaZop9drLyzuMNmqq2ZomK6orfErGSpnaJisrG10qibnmaYqbqtew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
