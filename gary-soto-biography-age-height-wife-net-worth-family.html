Regarding his relationship with the Mexican-American community, Soto commented "as a writer, my duty is not to make people perfect, particularly Mexican Americans. I’m not a cheerleader. I’m one who provides portraits of people in the rush of life."</p><p>In 2014, Soto received the Phoenix Award for his 1994 children's book Jesse. The award committee stated: "Jesse is both a coming-of-age story of one Mexican-American boy with a poetic sensibility and the story of a community and a country at a difficult time—facing poverty and prejudice and war, problems we are still facing today. Jesse offers an unembellished slice of life in Vietnam-era Fresno, California."</p><p>In 2011, the Old Administration Building at Fresno City College became the permanent home of the Gary Soto Literary Museum.</p><p>Soto was a 'Young People's Ambassador' for the United Farm Workers of America, introducing young people to the organization's work and goals.

They were illustrated by Susan Guevara, and the second one Chato and the Party Animals (Chato y los amigos pachangueros.) (2000) won the Pura Belpre Medal for best illustration in 2002. The series continued with Chato Goes Cruisin' (2004) and Chato's Day of Dead (2006).</p><p>In 1993, Soto received the <a href=#>Andrew Carnegie</a> Medal for Film Excellence from the Association for Library Service to Children for his production work on the film The Pool Party.

The New York Times Book Review also honored the book by reprinting six of the poems.

In his youth, he worked in the fields of the San Joaquin Valley. Soto's father died in 1957, when he was five years old. As his family had to struggle to find work, he had little time or encouragement in his studies, hence, he was not a good student.
