But it also means something that's a little less sweet and innocent: April Fools' Day. April 1 is better known as April Fools' Day, the one day a year when pranks are encouraged by everyone, even someone like your boss <a href=# class=T3D>or a random huge company</a>. It's a day when you can't trust anything you hear or anything you see on the internet, and it can be a struggle, to be honest! If you want to post about your own prank or something about the holiday, you can share one of these punny <a href=# class=T3D>April Fools' Day Instagram captions</a> with a photo and at the very least you'll get some likes out of it.</p><p>If you're feeling less than enthused about April Fools' Day, then getting some Instagram engagement might help lift your spirits. It's also interesting to think about the history of this weird holiday. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Some historians think</a> it may date back to 1582, around the time when France switched the Julian calendar to the Gregorian calendar, which meant a lot of people didn't realize that the start of the new year had moved to Jan. 1 instead of the last week of March through April 1. Those people basically became a joke to everyone else.</p><p>There are other theories that April Fools' Day has roots in the ancient Roman festival called Hilaria, which was celebrated at the end of March when people dressed up in disguises. Some think the holiday is linked to the Spring Equinox because of the unpredictable weather that often comes with the beginning of spring.</p><p>Whatever the case, this is a holiday we basically all celebrate now, even if we don't really want to, so it’s best to just embrace it! Take a photo and use one of these April Fools' Day puns as your Instagram caption.</p><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">1</h2></p><h2>Tomorrow is April Fools’ Day. Believe nothing, and trust no one. So it's like any other day.</h2><p>Nothing like a little sarcasm to get through this day. Plus, it’s a good caption if you have a few tricks up your sleeve for the day as well.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">2</h2></p><h2>What monster plays the most April Fools’ jokes? Prankenstein!</h2><p>Okay, this is extremely corny, but it's actually a very adorable little pun. And who doesn’t like an innocent joke like this one on a day when all the jokes are typically higher stakes?</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">3</h2></p><h2>Hello April, please don't fool me.</h2><p>This caption is a simple way to manifest some intentions for the new month. It also makes it clear that you definitely don't want to be the butt of anyone's jokes today.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">4</h2></p><h2>"Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me." - Proverb</h2><p>You’ve heard this one before, but April 1 is the best time to use it alongside your Instagram photo. That being said, if you happen to have some lingering beef with your followers... they might think it’s about them.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">5</h2></p><h2>I've always wondered why there is a day dedicated to fools. I see fools every day, and frankly, I'm sick of it.</h2><p>Not to be negative or anything, but yeah, this one is pretty accurate. If you’re Instagram tone tends to be sarcastic, this is the one for you.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">6</h2></p><h2>Who needs April Fools’ when your whole life is a joke?</h2><p>This caption is great for photo dumps where you can share photos from your whole, joke-filled life. A little self-deprecation never hurt anyone, anyway.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">7</h2></p><h2>"Here cometh April again, and as far as I can see the world hath more fools in it than ever." - Charles Lamb</h2><p>This basically describes life right now and always. The wording also makes it sounds like a serious sentiment before it turns into a full-on roast.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">8</h2></p><h2>I don’t think I’ll worry about any April Fools’ Day pranks, I’ll be too excited that it’s the weekend.</h2><p>If your priorities are more about the weekend than pranks, I feel you. TGIF has never been more real.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">9</h2></p><h2>I wish your workday won’t be as boring as a multi-billion dollar company’s April Fools’ Day prank.</h2><p>Most of the crazy schemes these companies come up with just can't be worth the money, right? Even if you end up getting pranked by a brand, at least you weren’t the person that had to come up with it.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">10</h2></p><h2>It’s not my fault I haven’t wished you happy birthday. I wasn’t sure if Facebook was making an April Fools' joke on me.</h2><p>For the people in your life born on this foolish day, you can be a bit playful in their birthday post. Hey, this holiday makes for some good excuses!</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">11</h2></p><h2>"We're fools whether we dance or not, so we might as well dance." - Japanese Proverb</h2><p>This proverb is weirdly wholesome. Despite the pranks you may fall victim to, consider this your reminder to always look on the bright side.</p></figure><figure class=W0r><p><h2 class="wW_ aB4">12</h2></p><h2>Nothing is foolproof to an extremely talented fool.</h2><p>No shame in being a fool, especially on April 1.
