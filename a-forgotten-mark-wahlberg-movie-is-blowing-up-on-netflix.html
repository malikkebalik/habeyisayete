The raucous comedy garnered strong reviews from critics and did huge business at the box office when it debuted in the summer of 2012, and became the fourth highest-grossing R-rated movie ever made at the time after raking in close to $550 million, before going on to score an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=444 data-current-count=444 data-injectable=true>The old adage goes that comedy sequels are the hardest to pull off given that the same jokes won’t work twice, but that apparently did little to deter MacFarlane, with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Ted 2</a> essentially a retread of the first film. As a result, the reception was much more muted in terms of both reviews and commercial revenue, with the second outing for the titular talking bear and his human companion falling over $300 million short of its predecessor.</p><p data-characters=0 data-current-count=0 data-injectable=false><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ted-2.jpg alt="ted 2" width=1200 height=675 sizes="(max-width: 1200px) 100vw, 1200px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p data-characters=380 data-current-count=380 data-injectable=false><strong>Mark Wahlberg</strong> was as game as ever in the lead role, once again cementing his credentials as an underrated comedic talent, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">but everything fresh about Ted had worn off</a> by the time the central duo got into another series of mishaps and misadventures. The sequel focused more on random celebrity cameos than actual well-written jokes, and as a result, everything felt a little forced.</p><p data-characters=398 data-current-count=778 data-injectable=false>However, Ted 2 has been playing like gangbusters on Netflix recently, and is now rocketing towards the top end of the most-watched list, where it can currently be found in tenth place on the global chart. It’s looking as though the foul-mouthed comedy will only continue to rise higher over the next few days, too, as subscribers seek out some good old fashioned dirty jokes and belly laughs.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonaiql6TBtbHNZqSaqptixKK0y5ucq59dory3tcRmmaWnp567qHnNnqufpJmtfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
