Recommended Videos The most hopefuls in the history of The Bachelor franchise stepped out of the limo — or the go-cart, or the speedboat, or the “little red truck hauling a Christmas tree” — and into the Bachelor Mansion to fight for the heart of the handsome Joey Graziadei on Jan. 22, marking the start of the reality mainstay’s 28th season."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While each and every contestant was stunned by her choice to kiss and tell, fans of The Bachelor franchise were equally as shocked, taking to X (formerly Twitter) to express their early opinions on Jess Edwards:</p><p>“Damn Jess with the fastest fall from grace we’ve seen in a hot minute #TheBachelor”</p><p>“Jess is already giving me the ick #TheBachelor #Bachelor”</p><p>“Jess kissed Joey, announced it to the room, and grabbed him for the second time and said she WASN’T trying to be that girl?! #TheBachelor #Bachelor”</p><p>“Me screaming at Jess from my couch right now #TheBachelor”</p><p>“Okay Jess… You’re officially annoying #TheBachelor”</p><p data-characters=246 data-current-count=246 data-injectable=false>Despite already being pinpointed as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">this season’s villain</a>, Joey Graziadei seems to fancy Jess Edwards nonetheless, offering her a rose and sharing the first kiss of the season with her. But will she somehow manage to secure the final rose?</p><h2 data-injectable=false>Does Jess Edwards end up getting engaged to Joey Graziadei?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Daisy-The-Bachelor-1.png><p data-characters=206 data-current-count=206 data-injectable=false>Unsurprisingly, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Reality Steve</a> confirmed that Jess Edwards does not get engaged to Joey Graziadei at the end of The Bachelor season 28, leaving fans of the franchise with just one burning question: Who does?</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=483 data-injectable=true>According to the Bachelor Nation know-it-all, Kelsey Anderson and Daisy Kent are Joey’s final two contenders, however, the Pennsylvania native will ultimately propose to the latter, giving Daisy Kent the final rose of the season, as well as a stunning Neil Lane sparkler.</p><p>“Just like every season, people will question, people will doubt, and contestants will post stuff on social media to throw fans off. It happens every season and this one will be no different, but come finale night, this is what you’ll see. Joey and Daisy got engaged in Tulum, Mexico at the end of the season. Obviously the finale won’t air until mid-March, so who knows what can happen in the next four months, but this is how the season ended.”</p><p data-characters=198 data-current-count=198 data-injectable=false>While we know that Jess Edwards ends up single after her stint on The Bachelor, our fingers are crossed that she makes a return to our television screens. She was born to be on Bachelor In Paradise!</p><p data-characters=199 data-current-count=397 data-injectable=false>Nonetheless, to watch the love story between Joey Graziadei and Daisy Kent unfold, catch brand new episodes of beloved competition series on Mondays on ABC, or stream them the following day via Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3ylu8SsZJ%2BhoqjBbrfIrKpmqpWYtrG1xKerZqKVqMBuscOwmKuco2Kyr7CMrqdmn5Wpwaq6xmacp5%2BRnLKledOoZKOnla56qL7As6CanJWeerC6jK2fnmWSlrCpscuoqWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
