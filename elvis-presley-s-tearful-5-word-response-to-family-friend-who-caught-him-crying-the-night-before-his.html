In the early 1960s, this living arrangement wasn’t as commonplace as today.</p><p id=par-7_20>There were two key reasons why Elvis felt forced to marry Priscilla. One reason was personal, and the other professional.</p><p id=par-8_35>Professionally, Elvis was reportedly violating a morals clause in his film contracts. By living with an underage girl, he broke that legal statute and could stand to lose a significant amount of his earnings.</p><p id=par-9_31>A morals clause protects an employer against any behavior that may be harmful to their image. By living with an underage girl outside of marriage, Elvis’ actions could have had consequences.</p><p id=par-10_49>Priscilla’s father, Paul Beaulieu, could have also potentially had Elvis arrested for violating the Mann Act, making transporting a minor across state lines illegal for immoral purposes. Although she was 21 when she and Elvis married, Priscilla moved to Memphis to live with Elvis in Graceland at 17.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>When did Elvis and Priscilla marry?</h2><p id=par-11_48>Before Christmas 1966, Presley proposed to Priscilla with a three 1/2-carat diamond surrounded by 20 more diamonds, designed by&nbsp;Memphis jeweler Harry Levitch.&nbsp;Five months later, Frank Sinatra&nbsp;loaned his private jet to the couple so they could fly from Palm Springs, California to Las Vegas to obtain their wedding license.</p><p id=par-12_27>Presley and Priscilla tied the knot in a room at the Aladdin Hotel in front of 14 people.
