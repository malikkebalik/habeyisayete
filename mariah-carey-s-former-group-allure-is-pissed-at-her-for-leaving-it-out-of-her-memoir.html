Unfortunately, Carey does not mention the group in the book, and group members are blasting Carey online for the omission.</p><h2><strong>Allure’s work with Mariah Carey and beyond</strong></h2><p id=par-3_33>Allure is an R&B quartet that began singing together in the early 1990s. The original members of the group were Alia Gray (née Davis), Hem-Lee (aka Linnie Belcher), Lalisha Sanders, and Akissa Mendez.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_36>The group caught the attention of Poke, a member of the popular production team Track Masters. Poke signed Allure to a production deal and helped it score a record deal with Carey’s Crave Records in 1997.</p><p id=par-5_32>It released its self-titled debut album in May 1997. The album features several singles, many of them collaborations, including “Head Over Heels” with Nas and “No Question” with LL Cool J.</p><p id=par-6_37>Allure’s biggest hit is its duet with R&B quartet 112. The song “All Cried Out” peaked at No. 4 on the Billboard Hot 100. Its debut album was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-7_34>Carey’s label dissolved, leaving the group without a contract. It signed with MCA Records in 2000 and continued releasing music, but its sophomore album Sunny Days did not receive much support from the label.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_36>The group left MCA, and Hem-Lee quit, leaving it as a trio. It reemerged in 2004 under NBA player Ron Artest’s record label to release its third album. It later formed its own label in 2008.</p><h2><strong>Allure blasts Mariah Carey for omitting it from her memoir</strong></h2><p id=par-9_65>Though Carey’s memoir mentions her work on her record label alongside her ex-husband Tommy Mottola, she does not mention Allure. In a recent interview with <a href=#>Vulture</a>, Carey explains why she omits certain aspects of her life and career from her memoir, saying, “If somebody or something didn’t pertain to the actual meaning of Mariah Carey, as is the title, then they aren’t in the book.”</p><p id=par-10_27>Per <a href=#>Madame Noire</a>, Carey reveals in the book that when her marriage to Mottola ended, she cut ties with the label and any other shared business ventures.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_36>Allure is less than happy about Carey leaving it out of the chapter about Crave Records, especially as Carey notes other acts she signed. The group members took to Instagram to air their grievances with Carey.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube aligncenter wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p>Source: YouTube</figure><p id=par-12_22>On the group’s <a href=#>Instagram page</a>, they share a vintage clip of Carey speaking about them being the first acts on her label.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-13_45>They allege that they’ve remained silent on their time with Carey with the intention of focusing on their career. According to Allure, there are rumors that things went south between them and Carey after one of the group members physically attacked Carey, which they deny.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-14_13>Overall, the group does not believe its contributions to Carey’s label are appreciated.</p><p id=par-15_73>“You had a label and we were your first act. We remember people always saying, “You guys were like the wallpaper at Crave…We’ve always stayed Quiet and been nice about everything although we didn’t receive the same back,” the post reads. “One thing that’s sickening is being treated as if we never existed. How does anyone blatantly lie and totally disregard people who were a huge part of your life and your career.”</p><p id=par-16_17>Carey has not responded to Allure’s social media post but continues her press tour for her book.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS6or7Imp9mm5Gnsrq%2FjJ%2Bmq6WVp3qovs6up2aZnKHCs7GMmqmeZaCewLSxw2aYrWWYmr9uss6rZKWdkau2r7OMrZ%2BepV2kwrV5zp9koZ2iYrqmuc6iqWaZXaG8sLeMm5ico12WwW7Ax56gq2WTlr%2BmsdFnn62lnGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
