Take a look back at the traumatic experience that involved Kanan having to strip down during one of the star’s early auditions.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sean-kanan-was-told-to-take-off-all-his-clothes-for-an-audition-early-in-his-career>Sean Kanan was told to take off all his clothes for an audition early in his career</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-3_62>Kanan and Maurice Benard used to work with one another on ABC’s General Hospital, but more recently, the two got together off-set and off-script. In an episode of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">State Of Mind with Maurice Benard</a>, Benard’s mental health podcast, Kanan spoke about everything from his award-winning TV series Studio City to the actor’s new book, Way of the Cobra: Unleash Your Inner Badass.</p><p id=par-4_35>As <a href=#>Kanan</a> pointed out on Twitter, diving into real and deep topics, the former General Hospital co-stars had very meaningful conversations throughout the podcast. Kanan opened up about his childhood and his experiences with bullying.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_38>The Pennsylvania native shared that martial arts and learning to be confident helped him greatly, but that doesn’t mean it was always smooth sailing. Kanan revealed how his insecurities manifested in different ways, including in his acting career.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-6_60>Kanan reflected on his first experience working on a movie, and leading up to it, in an audition, he had to take all of his clothes off for a room full of people. Kanan’s competition, who was also in the room, was expected to do the same thing.&nbsp;While speaking with Benard, Kanan revealed it was something he would never forget.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-sean-kanan-is-opening-up-about-the-traumatic-event-he-once-had-during-an-audition>Sean Kanan is opening up about the traumatic event he once had during an audition&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_48>When Kanan recounted the traumatic story to Benard, he explained, “I feel so embarrassed and stupid about it.” Apparently, according to Kanan, the reasoning was to see if the actors had any tattoos, and a young and relatively inexperienced Kanan, who wanted the role badly, got completely naked.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_53>Looking back on the disturbing encounter, <a href=#>Kanan</a> realizes how wrong it was and how it now affects his process and work today. When dealing with nude scenes as a producer, Kanan shared he tries very hard to make sure the actors are comfortable and he limits the number of people in the room.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_61>While speaking with Benard, Kanan admitted he would like to think he would handle the matters just as carefully and sensitively had it not been for his traumatic experience, but, nevertheless, wants to do whatever he can to protect actors, especially young ones. Wanting to avoid making someone feel the humiliation he once did, Kanan’s considerate and thoughtful nature is evident.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-has-sean-kanan-been-up-to>What has Sean Kanan been up to?&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-4></figure><p id=par-10_55>In addition to his role as Deacon Sharpe on CBS’s The Bold and the Beautiful, Kanan’s fans and followers have enjoyed watching him take on the part of Dr. Pierce Hartley in Studio City.
