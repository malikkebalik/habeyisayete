When she was a teen, she moved back to London to try to make it in the music industry.</p><p id=par-3_89>“My parents never pushed me towards music,” she said in an interview with <a href=#>Harper’s Bazaar</a>. “I feel like growing up in a musical household and always being surrounded by it, I was always kind of a performer child. I remember my parents would have guests over and they would bring their kids and I would make sure that we were ready to put a show on. I was like, ‘Okay, everybody stop your conversation. We’re coming to do a show.’ It was something that I always loved to do.”</p><p id=par-4_66>Lipa also loves to dance and it complimented her love for music.” It was kind of inevitable, I guess, my love for music,” she explained to the publication. “I’ve always been so in love with it and so inspired by it from making shows in the living room and doing dance routines in the school playground to like, ‘1, 2 Step’ by Ciara and Missy Elliott.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2>Dua Lipa was a model before making it in the music industry</h2><p id=par-5_28><a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>She started posting a lot of covers</a>&nbsp;on YouTube of artists like Christina Aguilera and Nelly Furtado. Lipa studied at both Parliament Hill School and Sylvia Young Theatre School.</p><p id=par-6_30>In an effort to meet people that could help further her music career.&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>She modeled</a>&nbsp;for ASOS Marketplace. While not being on the show, Lipa&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>starred in an ad</a>&nbsp;for&nbsp;The X Factor&nbsp;back in 2013.</p><p id=par-7_67>This same year, she signed with Tap Management&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>while she was still working as a waitress</a>. After they offered her a monthly salary, she left waitressing and began doing music full time. She would go on to write the song “Hotter Than Hell,” which she released in 2016. The song allowed her to sign a deal with Warner Music Group in 2015. From there, the rest is history.</p><h2>Dua Lipa continues to rise in the music industry</h2><p id=par-8_17>Her self-titled debut album was a hit worldwide and it included her huge single, “New Rules.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_46>A lot of fans have believed that Dua Lipa is tall, especially given a recent Instagram photo she posted for her brother’s 15th birthday.
