Max Baer Jr. is best known for playing the dimwitted Jethro Bodine on the television sitcom "The Beverly Hillbillies." While the role brought him legions of fans, it also brought his acting career to a relative standstill, as he was subsequently offered similar roles for the rest of his career. He shifted his focus to directing and producing, and went on to shoot some of the most financially successful films in Hollywood's history. His 1974 film, "Macon County Line", held the record for the highest grossing film per dollar invested until the "Blair Witch Project" was released in 1999. He also produced, directed, and acted in the films "The Wild McCullochs" and "Ode to Billy Joe." Among his other ventures, Baer has been involved in the gambling industry, and unsuccessfully attempted to develop a "Beverly Hillbillies"-themed hotel and casino in the 00s.</p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>Max Baer Jr. was born on December 4, 1937 in Oakland, California to Mary Sullivan and former world heavyweight champion boxer Max Baer.

Subsequently, he appeared in two episodes of the ABC anthology series "Love, American Style." Having mostly focused on big-screen work during the decade, Baer returned to television in 1979 with a guest role on ABC's "Fantasy Island." In the early 80s, he was in the television films "The Asphalt Cowboy" and "The Circle Family." Later that decade, Baer appeared in episodes of the crime drama series "Matt Houston" and "Murder, She Wrote."</p><h2 id=film-career><strong>Film Career</strong></h2><p>Baer had his first big-screen role in the 1967 Western "A Time for Killing," starring <a href=# title="Glenn Ford Net Worth">Glenn Ford</a> and Inger Stevens.

Having noticed that tourists were paying to take a tour of the Ponderosa Ranch, which had been used in the television show "Bonanza," he realized he could be making money off of "Beverly Hillbillies"-themed attractions. In response, he bought the sublicensing rights to the show from CBS. By the end of the 1990s, Baer had 65 "Beverly Hillbillies" slot machines installed across multiple casinos.</p><p>In 2003, Baer attempted to expand the casino presence of "The Beverly Hillbillies" brand by redeveloping a former Walmart in Carson City, Nevada into a "Beverly Hillbillies" hotel and casino. However, he was unsuccessful due to building code conflicts. Baer later tried to resurrect his plan on another parcel of land in Nevada, where he sought to create a 40,000-square-foot gambling area with slot machines and various eateries. There was also to be a 200-foot-tall mock oil derrick spouting a flame. This plan, too, was suspended, mired in litigation with the developer and Douglas County.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Baer married Joanne Hill in 1966; they divorced in 1971. Later in his life, Baer was in a relationship with model Chere Rhodes, with whom he lived in Lake Tahoe. Rhodes, 40 years his junior, killed herself in early 2008.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6pLHLnpmroaSesrR7wJyrqKqjZLqixIybmJ6qXZ%2B%2FbrrErWSwp6KptXA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
