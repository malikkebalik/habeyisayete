A key reason for the Clippers' success? Kawhi Leonard and Paul George have remained healthy. The Clippers have also been getting accustomed to James Harden after trading for him a week into the season.
The team doesn't want to lose a good thing, so it's making sure to compensate its stars, starting with Leonard."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The deal kicks in next season and will pay Leonard $52 million in 2024-25 and then a little more than $50 million over both of the next two seasons.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-357688 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GettyImages-1922909254.jpg alt width=900 height=600 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-357688 class=wp-caption-text>Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images</p><p>This new contract is actually a bit of a discount for Leonard. Entering this season, he was eligible for a four-year, $223 million supermax deal. The same deal is on the table for George.</p><p>Leonard had a $48.7 million player option for next season, so this deal will give him a small raise. George has the same $48.7 million option for next year, though he'll likely look to secure a longer contract.</p><p>The Clippers will do whatever they can to keep their stars intact, as they're enjoying one of their better seasons since George and Leonard joined forces back in 2019.</p><p>Leonard has made more than $276.5 million over his NBA career. By the time this contract ends after the 2026-27 season, he'll be north of $428 million in career earnings.</p><p>He's also won a championship on both of his prior teams. Leonard won Finals MVP as the Spurs took home the title in 2014. And before the 2018-19 season, the Toronto Raptors traded for Leonard. He spent one season in Toronto, winning a championship (and another Finals MVP) before heading to L.A.</p><p>The Clippers are hoping he can do the same for them — and they're willing to pay a lot of money to make it happen.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcL%2FPqKmtq12jsri%2FjqSYsKCZYrmmu82aqZ1lp565rXnNqK5mmpViuqK3yKeeZqWfp7JuwMeapWZtYGK6qrjLoqanZaCav26%2FxJqqqKZf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
