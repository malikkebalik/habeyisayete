Even with gas prices dropping, that would sure save everyone a lot of money. BMW's new M4 GTS may not run on water, but it does utilize water injection technology. The M4 GTS is so popular that it has sold out of all 700 examples before they have even rolled off of the production line. In fact, it only took two months for all of these water injected luxury cars to be promised to new owners.</p><p>The BMW M4 GTS features a 3.0 liter twin-turbocharged straight-six engine and a seven-speed M DCT transmission that sends all of the power to the car's rear wheels. This car has almost 500 horsepower and can go from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 3.8 seconds, with a top speed of 190 mph. Many efforts were made to keep this Beemer light weight, including taking out the rear seats, lightening the door panels and center console, and using straps instead of interior door handles.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-177191 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-495884878.jpg alt="Getty Images" width=900 height=601 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-177191 class=wp-caption-text>Getty Images</p><p>The M4 GTS sits on Michelin Pilot Sport Cup 2 tires and also has carbon-ceramic brakes. The carmaker used a lot of carbon fiber, including the car's hood. The new M4 also has an adjustable rear wing and titanium exhaust to make it sound as good as it looks. An optional upgrade is the Clubsport Package which adds a harness, a fire extinguisher, and an Acid Orange roll bar to your car.</p><p>Out of the 700 examples being made, only 300 of those will be sent to the United States. The BMW M4 GTS is said to cost about <strong>$180 thousand</strong>, and buyers can choose from Sapphire Black, Alpine White, Mineral Grey, or Frozen Dark Grey exteriors. The M4 succeeds the M3 GTS, which was only available in a burnt orange. M4s are even used as safety cars for the Moto GP motorcycle racing championships.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-177192 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/GettyImages-494649772.jpg alt="TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA/AFP/Getty Images" width=900 height=621 sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-177192 class=wp-caption-text>TOSHIFUMI KITAMURA/AFP/Getty Images</p><p>As for how the water injection system works, this old concept has been reimagined by BMW. A cooling mist is sprayed into the intake air which helps reduce the temperature inside the cylinder. That helps improve combustion and gives the turbocharged engine a boost by lowering heat related stress and knocking. This process can help reduce emissions and slightly improve fuel economy. The good news is that the system will still work even if the water tank is dry. With these amazing BMW models selling out so far, perhaps more will be coming down the line.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue8Crq6KbnJrAcK%2FEpZybqpmpxm6vwKuqaKSRqbK0wIybpLBlnaSxpriMmqOrnZGZxm6%2FzqWbaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
