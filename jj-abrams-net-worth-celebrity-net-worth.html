Abrams has won several accolades and nominations including Emmy Awards, Writers Guild of America Awards, BAFTA Awards, Directors Guild of America, Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films, PGA Award, to name just a few.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-308201 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2009/11/JJ-Abrams-1.jpg alt width=900 height=575 sizes="(max-width: 1500px) 100vw, 1500px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-308201 class=wp-caption-text>(Photo by Keith Tsuji/Getty Images)</p><h2 id=personal-life-real-estate><strong>Personal Life and Real Estate</strong></h2><p>J.J and his wife <a href=# title="Katie McGrath Net Worth">Katie McGrath</a> have been married since 1996. In addition to having three children; August, Henry and Gracie, they are also co-founders of their production company "Bad Robot". In February 2014 they spent nearly $15 million on a home in the Pacific Palisades area of Los Angeles. In April 2017 the couple spent $6.75 million on another house in the same neighborhood.</p><h2 id=warnermedia-deal><strong>WarnerMedia Deal</strong></h2><p>In June 2019 rumors swirled that J.J. and his production house Bad Robot was poised to close a $500 million development deal with one of the major networks/streaming platforms. In September 2019 it was confirmed that J.J. had actually signed a five-year $250 million deal with WarnerMedia Film. Interestingly, unlike deals signed by other large producers/creators, J.J. and Katie's deal did NOT involve selling their backend rights to previous work. For example when <a href=# title="Ryan Murphy Net Worth">Ryan Murphy</a> signed a <a href=#>five-year $300 million deal</a> with Netflix he had to agree to give up the rights to his full backend (streaming, theatrical) for all his previous projects. Same for when <a href=#>Greg Belanti signed a $400 million</a> deal with WarnerMedia.</p><p>According to The Hollywood Reporter, J.J.'s WarnerMedia deal is worth $250 million at a minimum and could end up paying out over a BILLION dollars if he successfully creates a feature film franchise for the network. He also reportedly turned down a $500 million offer from Apple because Apple does not have a theatrical distribution strategy, IP for him to adapt into movies and it would have required him to make content exclusively for Apple.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6o8HSoqWeq6Oisq97z6umna2Tmr%2B0e8mjZJqaopa6tHnNnqtmr5%2Bnwal7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
