The Wrong Missy stars Orange Is the New Black alum Lauren Lapkus, and also features actors&nbsp;David Spade and <a href=#>Rob Schneider</a>. But what is the Netflix film The Wrong Missy about?</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>‘The Wrong Missy’ comes from Adam Sandler’s production company, Happy Madison Productions</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Wrong-Missy-3.jpg><p id=par-2_61><a href=#>The Los Angeles Times</a> explained that, in the Adam Sandler-produced The Wrong Missy, “David Spade plays Tim Morris,” a man who can’t get over his former fiancée. Tim “goes on an arranged blind date with a woman named Melissa (Lauren Lapkus),” described as an “antic, eccentric, unpredictable handful.” Then, Tim encounters another Melissa (played by Molly Sims), and develops some chemistry.</p><p id=par-3_42>“Before a corporate retreat to Hawaii, he means to invite Sims’ Melissa but texts Lapkus’ Melissa by mistake,” the Times’ recap continued. “By the time he realizes the mix-up, it’s too late.” Thus sets off an interesting, to say the least, trip.</p><p id=par-4_25>Adam Sandler doesn’t direct or even star in the movie but his influence is all over The Wrong Missy. The <a href=#>Los Angeles Daily News</a> noted:</p><p>… while Sandler himself doesn’t appear in it, the movie that debuts on Netflix on Wednesday, May 13 has Happy Madison veterans on screen — in addition to Spade, such regulars as Rob Schneider, Nick Swardson, and Jackie Sandler, Adam Sandler’s wife — and off.</p><p id=par-5_29>Also, as the Los Angeles Times pointed out, the Wrong Missy script is written by “Chris Pappas and Kevin Barnett, who wrote the 2016 Spade-Sandler vehicle The Do-Over.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Cast member Lauren Lapkus steals the show in ‘The Wrong Missy’</h2><p id=par-6_41>But the standout comedian from The Wrong Missy is actress Lauren Lapkus. She previously appeared in Between Two Ferns, Orange Is the New Black and Crashing. Lapkus told the Daily News about what it was like to shoot the Netflix film.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed-youtube wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_42>“One thing that’s really nice is that there is a feeling of family within the production because a lot of people are actually related,” The Wrong Missy star explained. “But even if they’re not related, they’ve worked together for like 20 years.”</p><p id=par-8_35>Lapkus was completely onboard with The Wrong Missy because of David Spade. The actress, whose background is in improv comedy, told the publication that she had “grown up watching [Spade] on Saturday Night Live.”</p><p id=par-9_24>“It was really, really cool to get to work with him,” she continued. “He’s just so funny, and he’s extremely kind.” Lapkus went on:</p><p>That was the main push behind me going to the audition, but once I really got into the material and got to do the movie it was so fun because this role is just so crazy. Missy truly can say anything, and she’s just living on another planet, so it’s very fun to play a character like that.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The 2020 Netflix movie gets ambivalent reviews</h2><p id=par-10_23>As most reviewers agree, the 2020 film is a fun romp, mostly fueled by Lapkus’ great lines — but it’s not a must-see.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/The-Wrong-Missy-2.jpg><p id=par-11_38>“The Wrong Missy is a lightweight throwaway, the kind of movie it is difficult to suggest one actually choose to watch, but if your algorithm somehow lands on it provides a certain harmless diversion,” the Times critic penned.</p><p id=par-12_25>Within a day of its release, The Wrong Missy was already trending No. 1 on Netflix U.S. So, it seems like people need a laugh.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMsKmoppdiuqq%2F0rJksKCRqXqqv4yam5qlXaiur7DLnqmsZZ6axG66xK2dpaGoYrqwwsieZJqan6rBb7TTpqNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
