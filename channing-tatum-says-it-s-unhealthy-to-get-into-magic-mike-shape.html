The actor revealed on <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Kelly Clarkson Show</a> that he was hesitant on a third film because he would have to do a lot of work to make his body fit the role.</p><p data-characters=210 data-current-count=554 data-injectable=true>“That might be the reason why I didn’t want to do a third one because I have to look like that, the actor said”, referring to a photo of Tatum as Land from the previous film. Here’s the interview below:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7mX40Bi_rR4</figure><p data-characters=65 data-current-count=365 data-injectable=false>He spoke about his weight fluctuations when he was younger:&nbsp;</p><p>It was a lot more when I was younger, but now I can’t get it off as easy so now I only fluctuate like 15 pounds, but I used to fluctuate like 30.</p><p data-characters=106 data-current-count=106 data-injectable=false>When asked if he did not work out regularly, or if it had to do with eating well, Tatum had this to say:&nbsp;</p><p>It’s hard even if you do work out to be in that kind of shape. Well’ is not even — that’s not even healthy. You have to starve yourself. I don’t think when you’re that lean, it’s actually healthy for you. It’s my full-time job and I can barely do it. If you workout twice a day, you have to eat completely right at a certain time.</p><p data-characters=277 data-current-count=277 data-injectable=false>The original Magic Mike film was released in 2012 to positive reviews and was a box office hit. Matthew McConaughey, Alex Pettyfer, Matt Bomer, Joe Manganiello, Riley Keough, Cody Horn, Kevin Nash, Adam Rodriguez, Gabriel Iglesias and Olivia Munn rounded out the ensemble cast.</p><p data-characters=364 data-current-count=641 data-injectable=true>The sequel, Magic Mike XXL also proved to be a critical and commercial success. While McConaughey and Pettyfer did not return, Amber Heard, Donald Glover and Jada Pinkett Smith were cast. Gregory Jacobs was chosen to direct the film, while Soderbergh stayed on as editor and cinematographer. McConaughey has also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">expressed interest in returning</a> for the third film.</p><p data-characters=271 data-current-count=271 data-injectable=false>It looks like Tatum must have already been doing that gruelling training as the movie has reportedly started filming. Magic Mike’s Last Dance will be distributed by Warner. Bros and Steven Soderbergh will return as the director. It will premiere exclusively on HBO Max.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJomqGZnqO2r7OMrZitrZ1iwKLF0magratdqrupscClq6GxXam8brPErWSipqSkeq6txqKaZqWZoLJuv8eap55n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
