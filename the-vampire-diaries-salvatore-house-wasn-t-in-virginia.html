The Salvatore House in 'The Vampire Diaries' is an unforgettable sight. The gorgeous mansion served as one of the main sets throughout the show's eight seasons as well as 'Legacies.' But unlike the show's setting, the mansion used for filming wasn't in Virginia.

But it didn’t film anywhere near the state. The pilot episode was filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia, and the rest of the show’s eight seasons were filmed mostly in Georgia.</p><p id=par-3_19>While Mystic Falls isn’t real, the town it was filmed in is. The “real” Mystic Falls is Covington, Georgia.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-can-you-visit-the-vampire-diaries-set>Can you visit the ‘Vampire Diaries’ set?</h2><p id=par-4_64>Given the show’s massive fandom, it should come as no surprise that there are The Vampire Diaries and Legacies fans running tours of Covington. The tours are run by a group called “<a href=#>Vampire Stalkers</a>,” who would hang out on set of The Vampire Diaries while it filmed in Georgia. The fans became such a staple that they built a rapport with the cast members.</p><p id=par-5_10>Per the Vampire Stalkers website, the tour features the following:</p><p>Take the&nbsp;Cast’s #1 Recommended Tour&nbsp;for the Vampire Diaries and see iconic locations like the Clocktower&nbsp;including the town square, the ever famous Gilbert House,&nbsp;Caroline Forbes’ House, all things Mystic Falls&nbsp;and&nbsp;many more scenes from all 8 seasons of the show including the&nbsp;EXCLUSIVE Lockwood Mansion. Access granted only to Mystic Fall Tours. Legacies fans will also enjoy this tour with locations like Malivore’s portal,&nbsp;the&nbsp;ever famous 80’s episode and so much more is now included on the Mystic Falls tour.</p><p id=par-6_12>The group also provides tours of <a href=#>The Originals</a> set in New Orleans.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/nina-dobrev-ian-somerhalder-vampire-diaries.jpeg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-where-is-the-salvatore-house-located-in-real-life>Where is the Salvatore house located in real life?</h2><p id=par-7_24>A funny thing about TV is that more often than not, film sets that you think are in the location aren’t even geographically close.</p><p id=par-8_56><a href=#>Netflix’s Bridgerton</a>, for example, used Castle Howard in York, England for the Duke of Hastings’ home. But the library in the house was actually in London. In The Vampire Diaries, Elena Gilbert’s house and the Lockwood mansion are in Covington, but the Salvatore Boarding House is actually an hour away in a town called Sandy Springs.</p><p id=par-9_54>The show filmed inside Sandy Springs’ Glenridge Hall for season 1. After that, a replica of the mansion’s exterior and interior were used for Damon and Stefan Salvatore’s home. That set was used for the rest of the series, as well as parts of The Originals, and it’s now the main set for <a href=#>Legacies</a>.</p><p id=par-10_29>Unfortunately, Glenridge Hall was demolished in 2015. According to <a href=#>Distractify</a>, the owners’ daughter (ironically named Caroline) had it demolished because getting the house up to code was too expensive.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMr5imqJmnsm6wyJqpop2jYsCiuNWaq6iqlWK1sMHSnmSwmaOjwW61zWatoqqXnruqrY2hq6akXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
