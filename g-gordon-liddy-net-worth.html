Gordon Liddy's career in government began after he graduated law school when he got a job at the FBI.

Bureau Supervisor at age 29, making him the youngest person ever to hold that title.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-170317 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/GettyImages-53023659.jpg alt="G Gordon Liddy" width=506 height=594 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-170317 class=wp-caption-text>Handout /Getty Images</p><p>He left the bureau in 1962 in order to open up a private practice. He eventually hooked up with Richard M. Nixon to work on the Republican's Presidential campaign. Liddy continued to move up through the ranks of Nixon's administration. He was eventually placed in charge of the Committee To Re-Elect the President, or C.R.E.E.P. It was through this position that Liddy orchestrated many nefarious plans on behalf of the Nixon Administration, including blackmail, covert surveillance, and other techniques designed to undermine Democratic candidates. It was Liddy who eventually took the fall during the Watergate scandal, serving a prison sentence of four and a half year and eventually served 52 months.

In 1979 he released his first book, a fictional spy thriller, titled "Out of Control". He would go on to write several more books including an autobiography titled "Will" in 1980 which became a best seller.
