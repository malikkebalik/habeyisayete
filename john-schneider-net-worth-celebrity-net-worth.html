His ex-wife has complained to the court that Schneider put himself in this situation by taking "crappy" movie and TV jobs. She also told a judge that Schneider makes around $2,500 to perform a single concert and "squandered" a large portion of his net worth investing in low-budget, poorly produced movies and TV shows. She further claimed that Schneider's primary source of income is an investment property in Louisiana.</p><p>In August 2019, a judge ordered Schneider to pay Castle $25,000 per month in spousal support, a cut of his SAG pension and sole ownership of their $600,000 property.</p><h2 id=early-life><strong>Early Life</strong></h2><p>John Richard Schneider was born in Mount Kisco, New York, on April 8, 1960.
