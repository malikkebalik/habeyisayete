After all, Harry Potter turned Radcliffe into a household name and global superstar. So much so that <a href=#>the young actor</a> had groups of fans following him home, and one fan even fainted meeting the actor.</p><p id=par-4_23>Despite this, however, he felt Robert Pattinson would have a much harder time with his Twilight fame than Radcliffe did with Harry Potter.</p><p id=par-5_92>“I think he’s had to do with kind of a lot more,” Radcliffe once told Access Hollywood (via <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a>). “I had a very gradual easing in to the idea of fame, because I was doing the first two films back to back almost. So, while the whole Potter film franchise was exploding, I was in studios filming and kind of unaware that this thing was going massive outside. Where as Rob, [he] was suddenly the most famous guy in the world. I think that’s a lot harder to deal with.”</p><p id=par-6_20>It was also interesting watching Pattinson’s rise to fame, as it was like looking from the outside in for Radcliffe.</p><p id=par-7_41>“I have no concept of what Potter looks like to the rest of the world because I’m so involved in it. So to watch Twilight kind of explode globally had been fascinating,” Radcliffe said in a resurfaced interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">MTV News</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-pattinson-felt-that-spending-years-on-harry-potter-would-ve-eventually-driven-him-crazy>Robert Pattinson felt that spending years on ‘Harry Potter’ would’ve eventually driven him crazy</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-8_31>Pattinson has always spoken fondly of his time acting alongside the Harry Potter crew. He didn’t just enjoy his time with the cast, but he admitted how the cast was treated.</p><p id=par-9_33>“It was a really nice environment on Harry Potter,” he once said speaking to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">HFPA</a>. “… Even compared to movies I’ve done since, it was very protected, the way the kids were treated.”</p><p id=par-10_36>But at the same time, the actor couldn’t imagine starring in the wizard franchise for the long term. The time he spent in Harry Potter put in perspective just how grueling shooting the film could be.</p><p id=par-11_41>“The Harry Potter I worked on was an 11-month shoot,” he once told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Games Radar</a>. “<a href=#>I couldn’t be doing that</a>. I don’t know how those guys stayed sane – they’ve been doing it for 10 years. I would go completely crazy.”</p><p id=par-12_35>Although he’d been starring in his own Twilight franchise by then, to Pattinson the vampire films moved at a quicker pace. It was the reason why he didn’t feel stifled by his own film series.</p><p id=par-13_46>“I guess I have no choice right now – because I’,m contracted to do them. But they’re all going to be done quite quick. I’ll have done three of the four by October of this year, then I’ll only have one more to do,” he added.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-robert-pattinson-once-revealed-how-he-connected-his-harry-potter-and-twilight-characters>Robert Pattinson once revealed how he connected his ‘Harry Potter’ and ‘Twilight’ characters</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-14_29>Pattinson took creative liberties when he introduced himself in the Harry Potter franchise. But he also decided to use <a href=#>the same introduction as Edward Cullen</a> in the Twilight film.</p><p id=par-15_32>“It was definitely my suggestion to jump out of the tree at the beginning of my intro [in Harry Potter], which I kind of repeated later on in Twilight,” he told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">GQ</a>.</p><p id=par-16_13>For <a href=#>The Lighthouse star</a>, it was simply done because he enjoyed the idea.</p><p id=par-17_24>“For some reason, I always have a suggestion to be like, ‘Why doesn’t he just appear just jumping out of a tree,’” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS%2FsK7Eq6tmqJGpwaq60qilZp6VocFuv9OasKKml2K1or7RsmSpp6SpsrN51qispZymmnqlvsivnKdlk6euu8WNoaumpF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
