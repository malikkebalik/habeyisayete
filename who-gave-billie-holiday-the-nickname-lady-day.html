However, her birth certificate reportedly reads “Elinore Harris.” She named herself “Billie” after the silent movie star Billie Dove. In her memoir, Lady Sings the Blues; Holiday shared how much she admired the actor as a child.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_19>“I don’t think I missed a single picture Billie Dove ever made,” she said. “I was crazy for her.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_62>Holiday’s love for silent films was one of the ways she coped through a traumatic childhood. The singer’s parents-Sadie Fagan and Clarence Holiday- were teenagers when Fagan gave birth to their daughter. Eventually, Holiday’s father left her mother and later became a jazz musician. Shortly after, Fagan married Philip Gough in 1920, which provided Holiday with stable home life for several years.</p><p id=par-5_57>Once Fagan and Gough divorced in the mid-1920s, she and Holiday relocated to New York City. When they landed in Harlem, the “God Bless This Child” songstress started working with her mother at a house of prostitution before becoming a teenager. Throughout her tumultuous childhood, the singer took solace in listening to other musicians <a href=#>such as Armstrong</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-how-billie-holiday-got-the-name-lady-day>How Billie Holiday got the name Lady Day</h2><p id=par-6_93>By the time Holiday turned 18, she was actively pursuing a career in music. She performed at multiple clubs in Harlem and created a name for herself in the jazz scene. While she was singing at a jazz club, producer John Hammond discovered Holiday. After they agreed to work together, Hammond and the “Billie’s Blues” performer started recording together. Eventually, the producer set up Holiday to record with up-and-coming clarinetist and bandleader Benny Goodman. Together, the musicians worked on two of Holiday’s early commercial projects, including “Your Mother’s Son-In-Law” and “Riffin’ the Scotch.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-7_77>Following the success of her first two songs, Holiday continued to perform songs around the country. In 1935, she also appeared in the film Symphony In Black alongside Duke Ellington. At the same time, she joined Count Basie’s band, which also included saxophonist <a href=#>Lester Young</a>. The musicians quickly became friends, and Young gave Holiday the nickname Lady Day during their tour. The “Them There Eyes” singer later returned the favor and nicknamed her bandmate “Prez,” per <a href=#>Biography</a>.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-billie-holiday-s-cause-of-death>Billie Holiday’s cause of death</h2><p id=par-8_59>Holiday and Young remained friends for many years. Although she was married several times, the “Fine and Mellow” singer and Young only had a platonic relationship. According to <a href=#>The Guardian</a>, Holiday planned to perform at her friend’s funeral when the saxophonist died of internal bleeding in 1959. However, his estranged wife reportedly banned her from coming to the funeral.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_56>The outlet also shared that Holiday worried about her mortality when Young died. Unfortunately, her prediction came true in 1959. Two months into Young’s death, Holiday admitted herself into the hospital after feeling ill. On July 17, 1959, she died of cirrhosis in the hospital at age 44, with $750 to her name, per<a href=#> USA Today</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS0osLEZpmipJyesm60zqWgnZmpYruqr8qnmKadXaGupcWMnZiyZpipuq17</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
