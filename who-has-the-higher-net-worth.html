However, which music influencer has the higher net worth?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Kandi-Burruss-and-Boyz-II-Men-singer-Wanya-Morris.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-kandi-burruss-and-boyz-ii-men-singer-wanya-morris-are-at-odds>Why Kandi Burruss and Boyz II Men singer Wanya Morris are at odds</h2><p id=par-2_67>Through her work with two of the most prominent girl groups of the ‘90s, Burruss’s songwriting skills became a hot topic in the music industry. Soon, significant artists such as <a href=#>Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey</a> wanted to collaborate with the writer. In 2000, Burruss got hired to write a song for Boyz II Men. The song “Good Guy” went gold, selling 500,000 units in the United States.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_65>Although the song was a hit, Burruss recently shared that her behind-the-scenes experience with the “I’ll Make Love to You” artists wasn’t great. During an <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram Live</a> chat with Eddie Levert and his daughter, Ryan, she claimed that the group was her least favorite working experience. The <a href=#>Masked Singer winner</a> said she was shocked by how her former friends “disrespected” her during the writing process.</p><p id=par-4_86>“I hate to do it, I hate to do it – Ain’t no love lost, I mean, this is 100 years later, so it doesn’t even matter – But yeah, I had a bad experience in the studio with Boyz II Men,” Burruss shared. “I don’t think I’ve ever been disrespected like that before in a studio in my life. It was crazy, really. But at the end of the day, that was a long time ago. Clearly, you know, we’ve moved past that or whatever.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-who-has-the-highest-net-worth-kandi-burruss-or-boyz-ii-men-singer-wanya-morris>Who has the highest net worth: Kandi Burruss or Boyz II Men singer Wanya Morris?</h2><p id=par-5_67>Shortly after Burruss’s Instagram Live clip circulated, Morris shared his take on his Instagram page. The “End of the Road” singer claimed that the issues with Burruss started over songwriting credit. Burruss allegedly wanted additional royalties and songwriting credits for writing the hook to “Good Guy.” Morris, however, explained that he and the group felt everything needed to be “down the middle, that way there’s no discrepancies.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_55>Following “Good Guy,” Burruss and Morris never worked together again. Nonetheless, Morris remains a part of Boyz II Men. The group landed a Las Vegas residency at the Mirage in 2020. However, the concert got postponed due to COVID-19. Although he’s not performing with his group, Morris has a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">reported net worth of $60 million</a>.&nbsp;<br></p><p id=par-7_37>As for Burruss, the reality star is in her 13th season of RHOA.
