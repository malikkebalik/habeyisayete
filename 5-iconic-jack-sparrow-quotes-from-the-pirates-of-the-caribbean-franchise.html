Published on May 21, 2022   3 min read Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow is the heart and soul of the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise.

We may never be seeing him return for a Pirates 6, but we still have a ton of golden moments from the franchise to hang on to. Jack Sparrow has made us laugh and cheer with some great dialogue throughout the Pirates movies.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Johnny-Depp-Jack-Sparrow-1.jpg><h2>Here are 5 iconic Jack Sparrow quotes from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise</h2><h2>“Not all treasure’s silver and gold, mate”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-2_44>While we often see Jack Sparrow as a clumsy, bumbling oaf, he is actually an experienced pirate with wisdom beyond his years. This quote proves that Jack does have some wise words that even people who aren’t pirates could use in their own lives.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-3_51>Silver and gold can bring someone wealth, but sometimes treasure can be found in other things. Meaningful relationships with others or memorable moments can be treasures worth more than what gold can buy. Jack has proven to be greedy and selfish at times, but this quote goes against those character traits.&nbsp;</p><h2>“I got a jar of dirt”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-4_53>While not a line that’s full of wisdom, it’s one of Jack Sparrow’s most hilarious moments. In Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man’s Chest, Jack is trying to protect himself from the Kraken that was sent by Davy Jones (Bill Nighy). So, he is given a jar of dirt that will protect him.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_68>When confronting Davy Jones, Sparrow boastfully waves around his jar of dirt and exclaims in a joyous song “I got a jar of dirt, I got a jar of dirt, and guess what’s inside it?” This moment is made even better when considering that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Depp improvised it</a>. Fans love this line and even believe that <a href=#>Depp may have referred to it</a> during his trial with ex-wife Amber Heard.&nbsp;</p><h2>“Why is the rum gone?”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-4><p></p></figure><p id=par-6_59>Throughout the Pirates movies, Jack always had a craving for rum, which could be why he always seems drunk. When stuck on an abandoned island in Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl, he is stranded on an island with Elizabeth Swann (Keira Knightley). To set a warning fire, Elizabeth burns all of the rum barrels.</p><p id=par-7_35>Jack freaks out and asks why the rum is gone, despite Elizabeth putting it to good use. Jack typically asks why the rum is always gone in almost every movie when he inevitably runs out.&nbsp;</p><h2>“This is the day you will always remember as the day you almost caught Captain Jack Sparrow”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-5></figure><p id=par-8_44>Jack often finds himself in tricky situations where many people are chasing him. He usually manages to escape and shouts this quote as his catchphrase. He considers himself a legendary pirate, which is why he assumes that catching him would be a huge honor.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-9_54>The best iteration of this phrase is in Dead Man’s Chest when he manages to escape a group of cannibals. He gets splashed by a wave before he can finish saying this and just casually ends it. Jack typically plays around with the delivery of this phrase, creating many different options to choose from.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-drink-up-me-hearties-yo-ho>“Drink up, me hearties, yo ho”</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-6><p></p></figure><p id=par-10_61>These words have been uttered multiple times at the end of the film as a tribute to the end of a fantastic pirate adventure. It also happens to be a great reference to the Disney parks ride. This line is taken from the song “Yo Ho (A Pirate’s Life for Me),” which is sung throughout the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_30>While it’s a great way to pay homage, it’s also a great line to end the movie. It celebrates a pirate’s life while ensuring that the pirate lifestyle will continue.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGSCbrXCqKWim12frqS3jKynmqqipMRuvdSoq56rXaW2s63Tnqpmp5ZiwamxjJyYq6GSl7KiuoyfqZqmk522tLGNoaumpF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
