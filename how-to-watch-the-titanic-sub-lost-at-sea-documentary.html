The resulting documentary, which is described by managing director of content for ITN, Ian Rumsey, as seeking to “chart everything from the exploration itself, to the rise of extreme tourism, to the rescue attempts,” reportedly tells “a very human story that has captured the nation which is about 5 people, all with families, who are trapped at the bottom of the ocean.”</p><p data-characters=266 data-current-count=266 data-injectable=false>Interested viewers outside of the U.K. missed out on the documentary’s original airing, but even stateside viewers have a second shot at enjoying the documentation of this massive global moment.

The channel’s website is offering up easy access to its documentation <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">of the underwater tragedy</a> to anyone with an account, which is thankfully easy to secure. In order to watch the 75-minute documentary, fresh Channel 5 viewers simply need to locate the site’s page, navigate to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">section for Titanic Sub: Lost at Sea</a>, and click the “sign in to watch” button.</p><p data-characters=611 data-current-count=611 data-injectable=false>From there, you’ll be able to navigate to a new pop-up, prompting you to register for a new account. Registration merely requires your full name, date of birth, email address, and a new password, and — once all of that is addressed — you’ll have full access to the site, including the new documentary. Currently, the site considers the video — which was initially viewable live — to be concluded, but it seems highly likely that access will open up once a bit more time passes from its initial airing. In the meantime, a slew of other interesting documentaries are available to pick through.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXam8bsPArZqhZaSdsm7AyK2Yp6GTYsC2roylpqysXZbBbr%2FEmmSdp5Oquqa605qpsmc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
