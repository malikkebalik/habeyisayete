In other words, there are cities in the US that have origins before the Revolutionary War even started.&nbsp;</p><p>These are 15 of the oldest cities in the US that you can visit today.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>St. Augustine, Florida, was founded in 1565, making it the oldest city in the US.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>St. Augustine, Florida. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Shutterstock</span></span></figure><p>Don Pedro Menendez de Aviles, an explorer from Spain, landed on the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>east coast of Florida in 1565</a>. Once there, he created a settlement and named it after the saint of brewers, St. Augustine. The city remained Spain's capital in that region for 200 years before the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>British took control of it</a> in the 1700s.</p><p>Over 450 years later, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>St. Augustine is a bustling city</a>, known for its Spanish architecture, St. Augustine Beach, Crescent Beach, Anastasia State Park, and the Castillo de San Marcos.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>The second oldest city in the US is Santa Fe, New Mexico, which was founded in 1607.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Santa Fe, New Mexico. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Richard Elliott/Getty Images</span></span></figure><p>In the 1500s, the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>"Kingdom of New Mexico" was owned by the Spanish</a> and its capital was San Juan Pueblo. But in 1609, conquistador Don Pedro de Peralta moved the capital 25 miles south and named the settlement Santa Fe.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, the city is home to the country's oldest public building, the Palace of Governors. It's also known for its thriving, <a href=# rel data-analytics-module=body_link>local artist community</a>.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>New York City was first settled in 1624, making it one of the oldest cities in the country.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>New York City. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Drew Angerer/Getty Images</span></span></figure><p>In 1624, the Dutch West India Company <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>sent about 30 families to settle</a> on what is now known as Governor's Island. Back then, however, the settlement was named New Amsterdam. A couple of years later, New Amsterdam's governor purchased the island of Manhattan from the Native Americans, and the population grew quickly.</p><p>Today, New York City is made up of five boroughs and is the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>most populated city in the US.</a></p><h2 class=slide-title-text>In 1630, the city of Boston, Massachusetts, was founded in New England.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Boston, Massachusetts. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Nate Hovee/Getty Images</span></span></figure><p>In the early 1600s, the peninsula that would become known as <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>Boston was controlled by Native Americans</a> until John Smith named the area New England to attract European settlers. By 1630, the Massachusetts Bay Colony was established and later renamed Boston after a small town in England. A few years later, the Boston Latin School and Harvard University were created, making Boston an educational haven.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Boston is still a college town and is also known for the Boston Common, the Public Gardens, and Fenway Park.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia, was settled in 1632 and continues to be a historical destination today.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Colonial Williamsburg, Virginia. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>The Washington Post/ Getty</span></span></figure><p>Williamsburg, Virginia, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>was founded in 1632</a>, and a few decades later, the College of William & Mary was built. But it wasn't until decades later that the city became well-known. After Jamestown burned down in 1698, the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>capital of Virginia was moved to Williamsburg</a>, which was named after King William III. Williamsburg quickly became an educational and political hub for the colonies. The city then became home to several firsts, including the first printing press and the first newspaper.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, the city of Colonial Williamsburg still welcomes students to the famous college. The city is also known as a tourist destination, as Williamsburg hosts reenactments of colonial times.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>Meanwhile, Newport, Rhode Island, dates back to 1639.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The Breakers in Newport. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>Felix Lipov/Shutterstock</span></span></figure><p>In 1636, Anne Hutchinson left Massachusetts as a religious refugee with a group of followers and <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>founded the town of Portsmouth, Rhode Island.</a> When differences broke out within that group, some moved south and officially founded what is now known as Newport. Over the years, the city became popular for its seaport and harbor. Eventually, the city turned into a summer destination for the country's wealthiest.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, Newport is still known as a destination for the wealthy, as yachts fill its ports and mansions are still in use. Most notably, The Breakers, a 19th-century estate, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>has become a popular tourist destination</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>When Annapolis, Maryland, was settled in 1649, it was known as the "Athens of America."</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Annapolis, Maryland. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>FloridaStock/Shutterstock</span></span></figure><p>Puritans who sought religious freedom settled in the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>Chesapeake Bay in 1649</a> and named their settlement Providence.

The city is well known for its role in the Civil War when it became an early supporter of state's rights and slavery.&nbsp;</p><p>Now Charleston is known for its historic charm, its Fort Sumter National Monument, and its plantations.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>In 1681, Pennsylvania's largest city, Philadelphia, was founded.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText>CEW/Shutterstock</span></span></figure><p>King Charles II of England <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>gave William Penn a charter to colonize</a> what became known as Pennsylvania in 1681. At the time, Penn was a Quaker, so he signed a peace treaty with the Native American chief in the area. Years later, that peace would be disrupted when slaves arrived in the city. Eventually, they passed the Germantown Petition Against Slavery in 1688, which was the first official ban on slavery in history. The city boomed economically and culturally, eventually becoming the City of Brotherly Love.&nbsp;</p><p>Today Pennsylvania is known for the Liberty Bell, Independence Hall, and the "Rocky" statue.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>One of the south's oldest cities, Biloxi, Mississippi, was established in 1699.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Biloxi, Mississippi. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText><a href=# class="image-source-link not-content-link" rel=nofollow>Rob Hainer/Shutterstock</a></span></span></figure><p>In 1699, French explorer Pierre Le Moyne d'Iberville landed in Biloxi Bay, according to the <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>Biloxi Bay Area Chamber of Commerce</a>.

Years later, Mobile played big roles in the Revolutionary War and the Civil War as a trading port.&nbsp;</p><p>Mobile, Alabama, is now known for the University of Mobile, the University of South Alabama, the USS Alabama Battleship Memorial Park, and the Mobile Museum of Art.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>In 1718, San Antonio, Texas, was established in the southwest.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>The Alamo in San Antonio, Texas. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText><a href=# class="image-source-link not-content-link" rel=nofollow>Dean Fikar/Shutterstock</a></span></span></figure><p>San Antonio <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>was founded by the Spanish in 1718</a> and named after St. Anthony of Padua.

Over the next few decades, the city grew so much that New Orleans was the largest city in the Confederacy during the Civil War. Eventually, the city transformed into a cultural hub, becoming the birthplace of jazz.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the devastation from Hurricane Katrina in 2005, New Orleans still has a huge musical scene, French influences, and a large tourist population.</p><h2 class=slide-title-text>America's first planned city, Savannah, Georgia, was founded in 1733.</h2><figure class="figure image-figure-image" data-type=img data-e2e-name=image-figure-image data-media-container=image itemscope itemtype=https://schema.org/ImageObject><span class=image-source-caption>Savannah, Georgia. <span class="image-source headline-regular" data-e2e-name=image-source itemprop=creditText><a href=# class="image-source-link not-content-link" rel=nofollow>Shutterstock/Christian Hinkle</a></span></span></figure><p>In 1733, General James <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-module=body_link>Oglethorpe of England arrived in the Americas with 120 passengers</a> on the Savannah River.

He decided to plan out the city as a grid — the first to do so.

From there, the city boomed, eventually becoming a haven for counter-culture, the LGBTQ community, and the hippies.&nbsp;</p><p>Today, San Francisco has transformed into a hub for technology and business, and it's known for being one of the most expensive places to live in the US.&nbsp;</p><ul class=read-more-links><li>Read more:</li><li><a href=# data-read-more-link data-e2e-name=read-more-link rel data-analytics-module=body_link>The oldest town in every state</a></li><li><a href=# data-read-more-link data-e2e-name=read-more-link rel data-analytics-module=body_link>Here's the best small town in every state</a></li><li><a href=# data-read-more-link data-e2e-name=read-more-link rel data-analytics-module=body_link>The most affordable small town in every state</a></li><li><a href=# data-read-more-link data-e2e-name=read-more-link rel data-analytics-module=body_link>The richest place in every state in the US</a></li></ul>Read the original article on <a href=#>INSIDER</a>.
