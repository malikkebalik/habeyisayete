The country stars began dating in 2006 and got married in 2011. Unfortunately, their relationship made headlines when they were headed for divorce in 2015. But Shelton and Lambert got candid about their romance before the divorce announcement. And Shelton opened up their favorite Christmas tradition.</p><p id=par-3_45>In December 2013, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Extra</a> asked Shelton about his favorite holiday activity. “The actual wrapping of the presents,” he answered. “That’s something that Miranda and I make a point that we do.

One of the two,” she said in 2022, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Outsider</a>. “And so I’m always like, when the studio gets intense, I’m like, ‘Everyone just take a break.’”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Blake Shelton once recorded tips for making festive drinks perfect for friends and family</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Blake-Shelton-Miranda-Lambert-1.jpg><p id=par-6_54>Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert loved a good cocktail around the holidays, and we imagine the same goes for Shelton and Gwen Stefani in 2023. In 2017, Shelton shared his favorite tips for making drinks around Christmas. He teamed up with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Smithworks Vodka</a> to tell fans how he loves to serve a cocktail.</p><p id=par-7_27>Shelton’s first tip is to add diet lemon-lime soda to vodka. With a citrus wedge on the side of the drink, Shelton swears by this classic.</p><p id=par-8_41>“My next tip for throwing a holiday party is to always add a touch of personality to everything you do,” the country singer added. He then threw a candy cane into the lemon-lime vodka soda drink for extra holiday pizzazz.</p><p id=par-9_31>“There’s one more tip to a Blake-style holiday,” he said. “Always raise a glass to your friends and family.” Shelton then clanked glasses with others in the Smithworks Vodka clip.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Miranda Lambert said she and Blake Shelton loved to decorate the house for the holidays</h2><p id=par-10_61>Blake Shelton and Miranda Lambert clearly loved spending Christmas together during their marriage. “It’s our light at the end of the tunnel,” she said, according to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Taste of Country</a>. “We can stop rushing around and just be together.”<strong> </strong>Regarding food, she mentioned Shelton loved to choose complicated dishes for her to make.
