But he wasn’t interested in just that.”</p><p id=par-5_85>The two musicians collaborated on the song “Stand Back” from her second solo album, The Wild Heart. “‘Stand Back’ was inspired by ‘Little Red Corvette,’” Nicks told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Rolling Stone</a>. “I called him and said, ‘Can you come to the studio and listen to this song? I’ve sung over your song and written another song and you may hate it and if you do, I won’t do it.’ He came over to Sunset Sound and he loved it – he played piano and guitar on it.”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-4-3 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-2><p></p></figure><h2 id=h-stevie-nicks-said-she-may-have-inspired-the-prince-song-raspberry-beret>Stevie Nicks said she may have inspired the Prince song ‘Raspberry Beret’</h2><p id=par-6_26>The Stevie Nicks song “Edge of Seventeen” inspired Prince’s <a href=#>“When Doves Cry.”</a> And, according to the Fleetwood Mac singer, she may have inspired another Prince song.</p><p id=par-7_26>“Prince and I were good friends.

The connections are all there, and very real, and very alive today, as they always were.”</p><p id=par-9_14>Some of the most famous images of Nicks depict the singer wearing a beret.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" id=emb-3></figure><h2 id=h-both-musicians-wrote-songs-about-vintage-clothing-stores>Both musicians wrote songs about vintage clothing stores</h2><p id=par-10_51>Stevie Nicks and Prince may have inspired each other to write songs about vintage clothing stores. “Raspberry Beret” tells the story of a young man captivated by a woman who visits the shop where he works. The lyrics even describe the hat as “the kind you find in a second-hand store.”</p><p id=par-11_54>And in the <a href=#>Fleetwood Mac song “Gypsy,”</a> Nicks sings about a San Francisco clothing store called Velvet Underground. The lyrics go, “So I’m back, to the velvet underground / Back to the floor, that I love / To a room with some lace and paper flowers / Back to the gypsy that I was.”&nbsp;</p><p id=par-12_32>The song references the time before Nicks was famous, when she lived with her <a href=#>then-boyfriend Lindsey Buckhingham</a>.
